Abstract
This article explores four different topics of conversation in technical and
professional communication (TPC) scholarship that overlap and connect
with contemporary issues in generative arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI): process
and iteration, theory and power, actors and activity, and the social justice
turn. The authors offer four nonexhaustive reviews of these conversations,
offering insight into key issues and texts that have animated discourse intheﬁeld and can directly or indirectly address the complex relationship
between TPC work and generative AI.

Writing is a technology (Ong, 1983). As a ﬁeld of academic inquiry, technical
and professional communication (TPC) has an orientation toward and a richliterature in writing as a technology that is helpful to draw from when we see
shifts, even leaps, in what writing technologies can do (Johnson-Eilola,
1996). In this article, we point to four speci ﬁc scholarly conversations
within the ﬁeld of TPC that correspond with epistemic and technological
shifts in both learning and workplaces. We gather them here so that those
new to TPC and those in adjacent ﬁelds may draw on these conversations
for guidance in theorizing and strategizing the emergence of generative arti-
ﬁcial intelligence (AI). We highlight these four conversations as starting
places for reading (see Appendix for a reading list of sources fromConversations 1 –3) and re ﬂecting on what TPC has dealt with substantively
in its recent scholarship and provide ideas about how we, as TPC scholars,
might offer our expertise. While each of these had its moment of being thepredominant conversation in the ﬁeld, all are ongoing. We have selectively
chosen speci ﬁc works that can serve as entry points for shaping our under-
standing of AI and writing and the impact of writing with AI on learningand working.
The four conversations can be understood as moments of reckoning.
Perhaps our current moment —characterized by the ﬁeld’s“social justice
turn”to matters of equity, identity and representation, and justice —makes
this most clear. It is not by coincidence that these topics are ascendant as
we grapple with generative AI and its potential to amplify bias, (re)normal-ize modalities and value structures of language that erase linguistic differ-
ence, and spread disinformation.
The expertise our ﬁeld has built related to the role of technical and pro-
fessional writing in maintaining structural inequity may prove helpful for
understanding how disparities can grow from generative AI. For example,
AI could amplify and normalize biases that are (over)represented in the
materials it has been trained on (Sun et al., 2023). And generative AI,
when presented as a monetized service that may become standard or essen-tial for a competitive labor or learning situation, could widen inequities for
those whose access may be limited (Hatzius et al., 2023).76 Journal of Business and Technical Communication 39(1)
Conversation 1: Process and Iteration
We begin with perhaps the most fundamental concept in TPC and across
writing studies: process. The ﬁeld of TPC is rich with perspectives and
frameworks to help writers, readers, and users of information create withwords and images. A common element in these frameworks is iteration, a
recognition that repetition and recursivity are key elements in writing as a
human activity. A key takeaway: repetition helps people to learn andbecome better readers and writers. With fewer repetitions, as promised by
generative AI, what becomes of learning?
Process and Writing Beyond School Settings
The act of interrogating process and iteration goes back to 1977 and more
broadly to composition studies, when Emig noted that “writing serves learn-
ing uniquely because writing as process-and-product possesses a cluster of
attributes that correspond uniquely to certain powerful learning strategies ”
(p. 122). Emig ’s work helped to ignite a research interest in empirically
observing the activity of writing in order to gain insights from learning
more about writers ’thoughts, contexts, and decision-making.
In 1986, Odell and Goswami made the compelling case for studying
writing in nonschool settings. They argued that “researchers need to
examine writing that is not assigned by a teacher and that has a purpose
beyond improving writing skill or generating research data ”(p. 201) in
order to build our collective understanding of writing as a kind of essential
human activity in modern life and work. Since then, workplace writing
studies have proliferated. These studies extend theories of writing toinclude the lived experience of people in many different contexts. As
researchers, we can draw on this expansion today as we contemplate
where, when, and why to use AI writing technologies in everyday writingprocesses. While the use of AI writing tools may indeed be problematic
in many school contexts, for people at work, it can make dif ﬁcult processes
easier, faster, and less expensive. Such nonschool contexts will no doubtmake for fascinating research opportunities to come.
Multimodality and Multiliteracies
In 2003, Prior and Shipka proposed a framework for considering an
expanded scope of literate activity in order to render the writing process
in a more fulsome way —“not for ﬁrst drafts [but as] a step in a longer
and blurrier chain of textual invention and production ”(p. 181). AsHart-Davidson et al. 77
writers, we map our process, and when success comes, we strive to duplicate
it—we develop internal algorithms to deploy again and again. Thus, the use
of generative AI would be just one of many steps in the invention, reinven-tion, and revising that make up the multimodal process of writing.
InMultiliteracies for a Digital Age , Selber (2004) provided a framework
for using three literacies: functional (How does it work?), critical (Why doesit work the way it does?), and rhetorical (How can I contribute to the con-
versation?). Selber wanted to help teachers of writing build and design effec-
tive, responsible computer literacy programs (p. xi). What better way to aidfaculty in developing such a program than an algorithm —one that provides
room for iteration and learning —that can be used by humans to improve it?
In 2019, Borgman and McArdle developed the PARS (personal, accessi-
ble, responsive, strategic) framework to help contingent faculty build, write,
design, and develop their own online classes. They view “digital technology
as an opportunity to take advantage of online spaces already being used bystudents and refocusing them for improving writing ”(p. 11). In doing so,
faculty can meet students in spaces they currently inhabit and will inhabit
beyond the perceived beta test of the university. Although the frameworkwas developed for course design, it leaves room for iteration and process.
The TPC ﬁeld is devoted to simplifying systems to be more inclusive, to
provide space for iteration and equity. Such attention to inclusivity, itera-tion, and equity should be applied to its pedagogy and research on genera-
tive AI.
Practice, Process, and Change With AI
Research conversations in TPC about writing practice must now evolve
once more to include nonhuman writing agents as routine participants in
the practice. We see this moment as parallel to the conversation that
sparked the broader ﬁeld of writing studies to consider collaborative dynam-
ics, common in workplace settings, not as the exception but rather as the rule
for the majority of writers doing the everyday work of composing, review-
ing, and revising texts. As writers, we are seldom individual authors andmuch more often part of larger systems, as Odell and Goswami (1986)
showed us: The organization is the author (see Paradis et al., 1986).
As generative AI further complicates this dynamic, possibly even
moving into the role of coauthor or author, the human contributions to the
writing process will likely shift and evolve. Not everything will change,
but the speed of our process steps, such as drafting, will change. The collab-orators might change. Where writing occurs and where it is distributed will78 Journal of Business and Technical Communication 39(1)
continue to change. The lingering lesson from our scholarship on process,
however, is that humans will pay a price if we take process shortcuts
enabled by technology. That is, with fewer iterations, human learning islost. And getting a textual result faster may be of little value to TPC
because learning is the goal, not speed.
Conversation 2: Theory, Agency, and Power
Technology ampli ﬁes power, and it can sometimes distribute it. Powerful
people have always had access to agents who can write on their behalf.With AI amplifying and distributing generative capability, some barriers
to access will likely fall. But new disparities may just as rapidly appear.
Although theory —which we use here as an umbrella term for a set of ideas
and concepts concerned with power, representation, culture, epistemology,
and the legacies of Marxist politics —might not have the currency it once
did within business and technical communication, many will be familiar
with its ascendancy and prominence within English departments across
U.S. universities (see Berlin, 2003). Eagleton (2003) noted that the body ofideas that came to be known as theory was largely a response to World
War II and “had their Roots deep in the age of civil rights and student insur-
gency, national liberation fronts, anti-war and anti-nuclear campaigns, theemergence of the women ’s movement and the Heyday of cultural liberation ”
(p. 24). The explosion of theory and its various expressions and permutations
(literary theory, cultural theory, postcolonial theory, etc.) changed the natureof academic inquiry in the humanities. As Eagleton (2003) observed, “The
universities which had been the very home of traditional culture, the citadels
of disinterested inquiry, became for a ﬂeeting moment, most unusually, the
cockpits of culture as political struggle ”(pp. 25 –26).
When English departments began offering courses in business and tech-
nical communication, faculty looked to theory as a productive body ofknowledge to outline the shape and aims of their work. In their reexamina-
tion of postmodern theory in business and technical communication, Wilson
and Wolford (2017) pointed out that much of the discipline ’s early scholar-
ship“was in ﬂuenced by the zeitgeist of 1980s and 1990s postmodern theory
and drew on postmodern and critical theory to de ﬁne and rede ﬁne, not just
workplace roles but some of our fundamental thinking about technical com-munication ”(p. 4). It is unsurprising, then, that Sullivan and Porter ’s (1993)
seminal “Remapping Curricular Geography: Professional Writing in/and
English, ”offers a “postmodern and/or feminist ”model of professional
writing in ﬂuenced by Jean-Francois Lyotard ’s postmodern theory (p. 411).Hart-Davidson et al. 79
Studying Organizational Contexts Means Reckoning With Power
Considering Sullivan and Porter ’s (1993) important mapping of the ﬁeld,
people might say that theory was an essential component in shaping the dis-
ciplinary identity of business and technical/professional writing as an area ofacademic inquiry. For example, drawing on Jacques Derrida, Hart-Davidson
(2001) argued that “we need theory. By this I mean that the ranks of working
professionals andacademics in technical communication should participate
in activity that makes the core expertise of technical communication explicit ”
(p. 147). Or, in another example, Winsor (2003) used the ideas of Pierre
Bourdieu, Michel Foucault, and other post structuralist thinkers to examinehow generic texts (re)produce power, direct action, and “distribute cognition ”
among multiple writers over a period of time. Further, revisiting Sullivan and
Porter ’s“Remapping Curricular Geography, ”Kent (2007) observed that their
“article continues to serve us well today by providing us with a better under-
standing of the social forces that shape our ﬁelds of study and, consequently,
regulate what we can and cannot teach ”(p. 13).
Our point here is that business and technical communication has a long
history of engaging theory. And while this history might be less familiar,
taken for granted, or overlooked by faculty today, the ﬁeld’s long engage-
ment with theory provides a useful set of concepts and vocabularies to
engage with the questions and implications of the rapid rise of generative
AI, especially, as we show in the next section, given the ﬁeld’s commitment
to understanding materiality and the in ﬂuence of nonhuman actors.
Foucault ’s (1998) “What Is an Author? ”is one possible, if not obvious,
starting point for excavating theory ’s usefulness in thinking through gener-
ative AI in business and technical communication. As a contrast to the view
of a self-aware and agentic writer who “deposits, with in ﬁnite wealth and
generosity, an inexhaustible world of signi ﬁcations ”(p. 221), Foucault
wrote about the “author function, ”which is “characteristic of the mode of
existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a
society ”(p. 211). Taking up the question of how the ﬁgure of the author
and authorship are articulated and reproduced at a certain cultural
moment, Foucault pointed to four characteristics to guide our understanding
of the “author function ”: (a) a link to “juridical and institutional systems ”
that determine and reproduce discourse (e.g., copyright, pro ﬁt), (b) some
culturally and historically speci
ﬁc degree of in ﬂuence on other discourses
(e.g., that of literary writers on scienti ﬁc discourses or vice versa), (c) a col-
lection of speci ﬁc and complex operations that lead to the construction of
“author ”(e.g., literary criticism, the attribution of style and motives, a80 Journal of Business and Technical Communication 39(1)
writer ’s personal history), and (d) the rhetorical elements within a text that
signify the existence of a “plurality of self ”and not a uni ﬁed subject called
the“author ”that precedes the production of a text/work (p. 216).
Authority and Authorship
As we better understand the impact of generative AI on our teaching,
research, and day-to-day lives, Foucault ’s (1998) analysis of the “author func-
tion”provides us with a useful heuristic. Following Foucault ’s four-part
method, we might ask, for instance, (a) How will generative-AI technologies
be monetized by the large tech companies? What regulations might be devel-
oped and implemented by legislative bodies across the globe? (b) How mightgenerative AI in ﬂuence policymaking? How might such technologies be used
to compose workplace documents? (c) How do we, as a ﬁeld, contribute to the
construction and perception of generative AI as a recognizable “author ”or
writing technology? What does the history of AI teach us about our present
moment? and (c) How might TPC researchers contribute to theorizing AI rhe-
toric and interpretive frameworks for identifying AI-generated writing?
As AI technologies continue to develop and our understanding evolves,
the questions we ask will surely be sharpened, expanded, revised. Indeed,
Foucault (1998) suggested as much when he ended his essay with one pro-vocative question that might serve us well today: “What difference does it
make who is speaking? ”(p. 222). With AI as an increasingly embedded
resource within our writing technologies, devices, and spaces rather thana stand-alone technology, we can see the currency of contemporary
theory such as Rickert ’s (2013) Ambient Rhetoric , which calls us to consider
more pervasive, subtle, and yet critical sensibilities such as attunement —an
ability to bring intentionality to moments when the conditions are right for
rhetorical action. Such critical sensibilities may well become (or are becom-
ing) new workplace literacies.
Thus, AI will, at least while it is new, create a compelling need for a new
understanding of the dynamics of power, agency, and authority. As we for-
mulate and pose questions, then, we should recognize that, as Eagleton(2003) posited, “if theory means a reasonably systematic re ﬂection on our
guiding assumptions, it remains as indispensable as ever ”(p. 2).
Conversation 3: Actors and Activity
Theory ’s proclamation and the ﬁeld of writing studies ’assimilation of “the
death of the author ”(Logie, 2013) may have already prepared us for anHart-Davidson et al. 81
alarming idea: The machines might soon replace us. Thinking about the
potential perils of AI could make us feel threatened. And indeed, we have
faced several recent examples exposing the precarious relationshipbetween human and nonhuman actors during times of disaster.
When Latour proposed the actor-network theory (ANT), it was to shake
up sociology ’s understanding of technology use and its effects on society,
countering a human-centered bias in the discipline of sociology. Latour
(1987, 2007) engaged in a thought experiment in which human and nonhu-
man actors might have equal agency in a given situation, suggesting that asan analytic frame, such a view is helpful for investigating situations in which
humans and nonhumans interact. Many in TPC have applied this frame to
technical communication work (Fraiberg, 2017; Jones, 2016; Potts, 2009;Read, 2016; Spinuzzi, 2008; Swarts, 2010). But with nonhuman agents ’
prominence and in ﬂuence seemingly on the rise with AI, does ANT have
any validity today? At a minimum, we need to reevaluate the ﬂattened hier-
archy that Latour proposed. Recent issues relating to disaster, expertise,
human intervention, and trust in machines have led to serious issues.
Nonhumans in the Loop
Let us consider a situation that occurred in 2018 in Hawaii. A worker at the
Hawaii Emergency Management Agency (EMA) made a mistake during a
drill that resulted in sending out alerts to the residents of Hawaii, advising
them, in all caps —the parlance of shouting online —to“SEEK
IMMEDIATE SHELTER ”because of an “INBOUND ”threat of a
“BALLISTIC MISSILE. ”As reported by the Centers for Disease Control
(Murthy et al., 2019), residents experienced feelings of sheer panic andthen anger as they received the alert and then learned that the alert was
indeed a mistake.
We could take the stance that this mistake was human error until we take
a look at the opaque interface used to send the alert in AlertSense ’s software.
Reporters at The Verge conducted an excellent breakdown of the failures in
the interface and the EMA ’s governance of the emergency alert system
(Lecher, 2018). The trust we have in government alerts is only as strong
as the reliability of these systems, but it is ultimately up to technical commu-
nicators to ethically design these interfaces, algorithms, policies, andsystems. Without a doubt, all of these issues are the fault of poor choices
made by leaders who trusted in these systems. Does that mean we should
have trusted the machines more fully, or does it mean we need a betterset of best practices about the governance of technology?82 Journal of Business and Technical Communication 39(1)
Should We Maintain a Positive Bias Toward the Human?
What does all of this mean for the future of AI and human actors collaborat-
ing on writing projects? It certainly points toward the continuous need for
human intervention. Writing involves more than just delivery. It involvesreﬁnement and understanding. That is, invention, iteration, testing, and
review require nuance, discussion, understanding, and the kind of encod-
ing/decoding that is less algorithmic and more empathetic. Without thecorrect ratio of human to nonhuman actors, your content may write itself,
but it certainly will not guarantee the context in which people will use it.
And at this point, we need to consider the activity theory with an emphasis
on human collaboration (Kaptelinin & Nardi, 2006), an emphasis that TPC
examines within con ﬁnes across time and space (Potts & Jones, 2011;
Sherlock, 2009; Spinuzzi, 2011). Rather than focusing only on the actionsand reactions behind these systems, perhaps we ought to use our available
means of persuasion to outline the ethical ways in which we can humanely
coexist. That is, perhaps we should think about technology and how it caneffect societal change for social good. As Spinuzzi (2023) pointed out, activity
theory and ANT offer complementary ways for us to examine these systems
and develop best practices for their use. A key difference, for Spinuzzi, isthat activity theory builds in a bias toward human consciousness by creating
a hierarchy of action that depends on motivated, purposeful behavior. In this
way, activity theory ’s humanistic bias can be an affordance, particularly in a
situation in which the overdetermined or hegemonic in ﬂuence of nonhuman
actors is more aligned with power than is the in ﬂuence of human actors. It is
easy to see, then, that in certain arenas such as policymaking, a human-centeredperspective may be seen as the most just.
Conversation 4: Social Justice Turn and What
Lies Ahead
TPC has recently had to reckon with the complexity of writing and commu-
nication as organizational processes. That is, the increasingly distributed
nature of textual work has blurred the line between human and nonhumanagency and the identity of the authorial agent. Now the ﬁeld is also reckon-
ing with the material disparities and inequities that its practices —and even
its ways of knowing —contribute to rather than work to improve. TPC ’s
efforts to understand writing practices across all the dynamics characterizing
the eras of process, theory, and activity/actor networks continue with a
renewed urgency in order to make a meaningful change with and forthose marginalized and harmed by these practices.Hart-Davidson et al. 83
Theﬁeld routinely brings a critical sensibil ity to the study of process and prac-
tice frameworks. Walton (2016) noted that TPC is “well positioned to combat
forms of oppression ”because “TPC is involved in crafting the communications ”
that can enact change (p. 412). In 2019, Walton et al. released Technical
Communication After the Social Justice Turn :Building Coalitions for Action ,a
book that reexamines the role of technical communication as a whole and theresponsibilities that come wit h it. They offer overviews of “distributive justice,
procedural justice, and three forms of legal justice (retributive, restorative, transi-
tional) before landing on social justice ”(p. 34). These overviews provide a frame-
work for us, as TPC researchers, to examine our own privilege and the privilege
that TPC work can perpetuate. Understanding privilege “provides insight into the
ways that technology prioritizes particula r users and in doing so, particular per-
spectives ”(p. 85). This insight can be used in examining generative AI: That
is, how can we, as TPC researchers and practitioners, be responsible and use
the privilege that comes with that responsibility to advance justice?
Less recent voices from each of the prior three conversations have also called
attention to social justice matters. For instance, in his landmark essay “The Ethic
of Expediency, ”Katz (1992) turned our attention to the weaponization of orga-
nizational authorship and its massive de humanizing, violent potential as talk of
the ludic possibility of a decentralized authorial subject reached its nadir in the
theory era. His warning is a check on dynamics that we see surfacing in discus-sions of generative AI today, including the ways that appeals to expediency can
afford rapid and massive scaling of deadly rhetorical power. As the excitement
about nonhuman actors was heating up, Sauer (2003), in her study of coalminer ’s embodied rhetoric, directed us to the distinctly human, material risks
of communication in hazardous conditions. And more recently, Sun (2020)
reminded us that the TPC community is a global one that comprises technologyusers, writers, and researchers and that the U.S.-centric view that dominates in
TPC scholarship sheds light on only a fraction of the rich activity that the ﬁeld
aims to understand. Both Katz and Sauer, then, in contrast to the tenor of mostTPC scholarship in their respective moments, raised alarms as calls for the
TPCﬁeld to use its knowledge to prevent harm. Today, by contrast, the call to
be vigilant and to work toward transform ation, toward justice, is becoming a
common cause for those entering the ﬁeld (Mckoy et al., 2022).
Prompting Dialogue: Can the TPC Community Lead
the Way on GenAI and Writing?
Although the Call for Papers for this special issue of the Journal of Business
and Technical Communication invited submissions that “center on how AI84 Journal of Business and Technical Communication 39(1)
tools change or do not change aspects of TPC work, ”our piece evades such
evaluations or predictions about generative AI and TPC work. Instead, we
have looked to work in TPC —to conversations that build and utilize itera-
tive frameworks, theorize human activity and power, and attend to the mate-
riality of writing and writing technologies in order to advance justice and
equity. By taking this kind of inventory, we are calling on our colleaguesto recognize that in these conversations, our ﬁeld has led and contributed
to an opportunity to bring our expertise to the table as our institutions and
the culture at large deal with how to adjust to generative AI in our workand personal lives. We are not starting from scratch.
The time to do this work is now, when generative AI is as transparent and
stand-alone as it will likely ever be. In the near future, GenAI capability willbe more embedded, more integrated into other systems and devices, making
it harder to detect, understand, scrutinize, and critique. Our voices as writing
experts matter a great deal. We understand from other moments of rapid anddisruptive technological change that there will be both positive and negative
developments within TPC as both a ﬁeld of academic inquiry and profes-
sional practice. With GPT (generative pretrained transformer), a technologywhose inception was not linked to solving a problem with writing, all of
these developments —positive and negative —are in a sense unintended
(Vaswani et al., 2017).
Indeed, we look forward to reading what others have to say about the
impact and implications of generative AI on our collective work.
Although we do not know what is to come regarding the effects of genera-tive AI —including shifting and new criteria to evaluate these effects —we
do know that the conversations we have outlined here serve as productive
commonplaces and starting points for understanding, in ﬂuencing, theoriz-
ing, and working alongside generative AI.
