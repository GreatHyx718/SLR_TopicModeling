ABSTRACT 
This project explores the nuance of human-AI collaboration us-
ing domestic knitting machines alongside a simple, task-based, AI 
algorithm addressed through the research framework of more-than-
human design. The textile design task is to use a broad range of 
knitting techniques to develop textile prototypes that mimic sea 
slugs, specifcally the New Zealand nudibranchs Jason mirabilis and 
Dendrodoris krusensternii, both chosen for their colourful, organic 
looks. The fnal outcome consists of a series of textile swatches and 
prototypes along with a booklet documenting the digital patterns 
and thought processes of the development.

Designers and artists who work with textiles, particularly knitting, 
are beginning to adopt Artifcial Intelligence (AI) into their creative 
practices as it becomes more generally known and more easily 
accessible. The current adaptation of AI for knitting fabrication 
is mainly implemented through image generation such as Mid-
journey [28], Dall-E [31], or StableDifusion [38]. Other computer-
supported implementations of knitting textile fabrication include 
optimisation [1, 3, 12, 20, 26], computation augmentation [2, 6, 36], 
digital interfaces [9, 40, 44, 47], creative algorithmic explorations 
[12, 15, 17, 18, 25, 32]. However, the combination of the creative 
process with algorithmic support in knitting is much less explored, 
unlike the feld of Architecture where there is a long tradition for 
parametric and algorithmic designs. 
In this project, we explore the nuance of human-AI collabora-
tion with a domestic knitting machine (hereafter referred to as the 
‘machine’) using a simple, task-based AI algorithm on the computer. 
AI, as a general term, covers a vast area of algorithms with diferent 
expertise. Previous research has found that knowing AI’s capabili-
ties allows designers to use AI tools better and that as a result value 
creation is closely related to specifc AI’s task expertise [46]. In the 
context of this project, we focus on the pattern-making ability of an 
extremely simple genetic algorithm to see how it would infuence 
the creative outcomes. 
This project adapts the framework of more-than-human de-
sign, where the material and the knitting machine are also seen 
as more-than-human designers [30, 41] in the craftsmanship tradi-
tion [19, 34]. The knitted textiles are also seen as outcomes created 
by the human-AI-machine-material assemblage [11]. Through the 
iterative auto-ethnography and process documentations of both 
the objective and the subjective perspectives, such as thought pro-
cesses, refections, data, photographs, choreography, and time, as 
an attempt to create a detailed depository of the happenings within 
the human-AI-machine-material assemblage that would portrait 
the interplay within the assemblage.

2 RELATED WORKS 
HCI research acknowledges the presence of fabrication machines, 
materials, and AI [5, 7, 19, 30, 41], and that the making of textiles 
is a collective process of the human-AI-machine-material assem-
blage, in which each has its own agency within the process. Such 
a framework shifts the perspective of AI as a tool towards AI as a 
more-than-human designer, which urges for a diferent lens to look 
at it as a more-than-human collective process. 
Creative implementation using generative AI in textile-related 
felds has become visible, especially within the feld of fashion 
[8, 21, 24, 27] with tools specialised in generating garments [29, 37], 
recommendations [22, 39, 43], or even as common as taking part in 
ideation[ 23], and many more. These generative AI implementations 
are mostly based on AI algorithms that are trained on a large image-
text dataset, which makes the authorship and originality debatable 
[13]. Beyond the fashion domain, in the textile realm, generative 
AI is still weak in generating proper usable textile textures and 
structures due to the fact that image generative AI works on im-
ages rather than patterns and structural logic. As a result, using 
generative AI to assist in the making of textiles requires further 
translation into actionable elements. This corresponds with the 
fnding from Yildirim et al. that, by focusing on sharing knowledge 
on the capabilities of AI, potentially addresses the gap between 
the capabilities of AI and the designer’s needs and thereby broad-
ens how AI can potentially be used in design [46]. At the same 
time, creatives are often looking for AI to deliver disruptive and 
strange, unexpected outcomes rather than provide solutions [4]. 
Furthermore, the concern of agency and originality when using AI 
tools [45] brings deeper questions around art labour and copyrights which is beyond the scope of this demonstration [35] but lays an 
important background for where generated data comes from. 
Coming back to the more-than-human design framework with 
the same question of how AI can integrate into the established 
collective process of human-machine-material assemblage, based 
on a meeting between its capabilities and the designer’s need, we 
constructed a setup of a simple 0 and 1 matrix manipulating genetic 
algorithm to participate in the creative development of textile de-
sign tasks. We did this in order to investigate if the perspective shift 
might bring new insight into the so-called human-AI collaboration 
studies. 
3 KNITTING THE SEA SLUGS 
The First Author (hereafter FA) is an Asian PhD student in the feld 
of design with a background in Biology, Computer Science, Cultural 
Studies, and Critical/Speculative Design. She has been a practising 
artist in international settings for more than 15 years in the feld 
of art and science. Knitting and textiles are not FA’s expertise, but 
she has amateur experience, having worked with domestic knit-
ting machines for three years and some training in Stoll industrial 
knitting machines. With this background, the project takes artistic 
considerations as its frst priority with design observations added 
on top of this practice. This approach is chosen with the aim of 
centring the artistic practices in order to reveal important nuances 
that are, in turn, at the core of the creative processes of design 
research. 
For this project, FA adapted a popular textile creative process 
as practised by textile design students across institutions: Starting 
from visual ideation, doing yarn swatches and simple swatches, and 
then continuing to more sophisticated swatches, and fnally, the 
319

fnal prototype. This approach is chosen to centre the perspective 
from the craftsmanship tradition to explore diferent technology 
engagements. Sea slugs were chosen to become the creative goal due 
to FA’s previous experience with turning biological structures into 
knitted textiles and to allow more freedom than a typical knitted 
wearable garment where more precise calculation is needed for 
practicalities. Sea slugs Jason mirabilis and Dendrodoris krusensternii 
from the book ‘Super Sea Slugs – a guide to the sea slugs of New 
Zealand’ written by Richard C. Willan and Niki Davy [42] was 
chosen for their interesting shapes and colours that attracted the 
FA instinctively. The yarns were chosen from FA’s collection of 
yarns. 
The creative process is recorded through photographs, auto-
ethnography, digital patterns, and an annotated portfolio [ 14, 33]. 
The whole process will be displayed in the format of a booklet, 
along with the samples from each stage. The booklet is the diary 
collection of the auto-ethnography notes, along with images of 
each sample, displaying the complete timeline of the process. 
3.1 The AI Algorithm 
The AI algorithm was developed by FA using Python on the ba-
sis of a genetic algorithm, which does not require a pre-trained 
dataset. Each time, two parent patterns were plotted by FA and then 
hybridised using the algorithm, generating a set of patterns with 
diferent mutation rates as a gallery to be selected from. The algo-
rithm goes through each digit of the two matrices (the two parents) 
with the same dimension that consists of 0 and 1 and randomly 
selects between the digits of the same position between the two 
matrices with a specifc mutation rate that changes from 0 to 1 or 
from 1 to 0. Then the algorithm assigns ftness to each generated 
matrix according to two conditions: 1) if the matrix has more than 
eight of the same digits continuously in a row, then a penalty is 
assigned, this is to avoid long foats, and 2) if the matrix has more 
than four of the same digits continuously in a column then a penalty 
is assigned, this is to avoid too many tucks. Matrices with higher 
ftness are selected and output as text fles along with images for 
ease of reading. This algorithm is very primitive and aims merely 
at generating pattern variations that might be more knittable in 
order to facilitate a faster exploration of the knitting-scape. 
3.2 Documenting the Crucial Nuances 
The documentation format takes inspiration from biology research 
lab journals from FAś previous education training and annotated 
portfolios as proposed by Portfolio of Loose Ends [16], along with 
auto-ethnography diaries to record cognitive processes, temporali-
ties, refections, practical information, and fnally digital fles that 
allow the whole choreography of creative knitting to happen. Con-
sidering that the creative process is organic and nuances might not 
ft into the preliminary settings, a draft documentation template 
was used as a guideline but developed during the creative process 
as well. The documentation form difered during diferent stages 
and was revised multiple times by reviewing all the complete pro-
cess records. The revision was to ensure that the documentation 
matches the needs of each stage of the creative process. The fnal 
documentation format is presented in the booklet, although all the photographs, drafts, and notes were kept during the creative 
process as shown in Figure 2 
The documentation contains four major categories of informa-
tion: 1) human interpretations, refections, and decisions of the 
information provided by the knitting machine and the material, 2) 
digital plotting of needle choreography (in digital patterns) and 
human choreography (manual manipulations), 3) physical facts 
such as machine, material, textile swatches in images 4) temporal-
ity that infuences the performances of all participating entities. 
These categories are being recorded based on the theories of human 
cognition that exist within the ’Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, and 
Extended’ [10], to fully know what the other agencies within the 
assemblage are thinking is impossible, we could still plot the sur-
rounding landscape [30]. In this proposal of DIS demonstration, 
the knitted textile samples along with the booklet of documenta-
tion as shown in Figure 1, 2, and 3 will be exhibited together to 
create a detailed representation of the occurrence of the specifc 
human-AI-machine-material assemblage while making the textile 
nudibranchs Jason mirabilis and Dendrodoris krusensternii. 
4 CONCLUSION 
This project demonstrates how humans, a simple genetic algorithm, 
a knitting machine, and materials could mutually inform and in-
teract with each other. The booklet and samples also reveal the 
nuances of the negotiation, collaboration, refection, and modifca-
tions at diferent levels between the human’s embodied cognitive 
space, pattern generation, machine control and choreography, and 
material performances in response to knitting structures. Although 
the creative process in this research is highly personal to the FA 
due to the fact that each designer would have their own creative 
process, it illuminates the vibrancy of multifaceted interactions 
within the human-AI-machine-material assemblage where the fnal 
textile creation is the co-contribution of the four groups of entities.

Reflections: It turns out amazing. The Tincel yarn highlights the yarn routes of tuck stitches.This is too beautiful to be ignored. However, because of too many tuck stitches in a row, it is difficult to knit and creates loads of errors. Some editing is needed.The knit was terminated half way so I can see the effect earlier, just in case it turns out not as nice. But the result is amazing.
