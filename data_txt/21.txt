ABSTRACT 
This research investigates the potential of emerging communica-
tion strategies to enhance engagement with climate change data 
through HCI, by recognizing the critical challenge of efectively 
communicating complex hyperobejcts. We designed "Finding Arca-
dia", an interactive artefact centred on ocean climate data, to explore 
how data humanism, storytelling, decentering the human in the 
narrative, and positive framing infuence user engagement and 
perception of the information. Findings from a study in-the-wild 
(N=42) and a post-experience survey conducted six months later 
(N=19) foregrounds strategies to foster deeper engagement and 
connection with the information but also tensions in engaging with 
such a complex topic. We contribute to climate change communica-
tion and HCI research with the design decisions, study outcomes, 
and refections on ways in which communication strategies can 
promote understanding and connection with a hyperobject.

1 INTRODUCTION 
The growing urgency to tackle climate change is compounded by 
its complexity and broad implications. Hence, it is referred to as 
a hyperobject – a complex and pervasive phenomenon that exists 
on a scale beyond our usual human perception and comprehen-
sion [80]. This scale makes efective engagement strategies both 
intricate and essential [115]. Although there is an overwhelming 
consensus that climate change is a human-induced phenomenon 
[65], it can be difcult to connect its abstract, global signifcance to 
individual experiences, leading people to not talk about the issue 
3029

[6]. This is particularly detrimental, as "one of the most important 
actions people can take to address global warming is to talk about 
it", according to climate scientist Hayhoe [6]. Conversations build 
understanding and change beliefs and attitudes. 
Emerging research underscores the role of the HCI community 
in championing climate change discourse, emphasizing hope, mean-
ing, and action [62, 66]. Yet, a gap persists in how we communicate 
environmental narratives to audiences [39]. The challenge of con-
verting intricate climate data into understandable, actionable, and 
emotionally resonant concepts remains [41]. Studies ofer varied 
perspectives on the efcacy of negative versus positive emotional 
framing [25] and the challenges of translating complex climate data 
into understandable concepts that are relevant to people’s lives 
[23, 33]. Recent studies have demonstrated that fear is inefective 
in motivating [83], while hope [19, 27] and action [32, 38, 51] can 
be catalysts for engagement. Such a complex communication chal-
lenge, allied with the urgency of engagement, demands further 
research and proposals of novel approaches. As a feld, HCI can 
leverage technology to engage, educate, adapt, and immerse people 
in complex phenomena requiring collective action [79]. 
Design and HCI research often focus on a limited range of topics 
and strategies when discussing climate change [40]. The clarion call 
from both scholars and international institutions [26, 82] is clear: 
we need diverse, relatable, and empowering narratives that resonate 
with specifc audiences [ 17, 35, 101], including more-than-human 
[1, 44] and cohabitation [75, 95]. 
In response to this imperative, we explore how to efectively 
communicate hyperobjects related to crises, such as climate change, 
through HCI. To address this high-level enquiry, we explored difer-
ent communication strategies informed by implications in previous 
research [39, 40] and current climate change engagement guidelines 
[21, 24, 82] – data humanism, storytelling, decentering the human 
in the narrative, and positive framing – through a case-study fo-
cused on climate change communication. This artefact – Finding 
Arcadia (FA) –, inspired by a study on the role of whales in carbon 
sequestration [20], serves as our experimental canvas. 
We performed an exploratory study where we created two ver-
sions of the artefact – a Base version (vB) and an Enhanced version 
(vE) - exploring the communication strategies chosen to probe what 
users are most connected with and how to make hyperobject-related 
data feel more actionable and human-scaled. We describe the design 
decisions behind the two versions of FA, and detail our user study 
in the wild (N=42) and probing six months later (N=19), describing 
its fndings and discussing emerging issues and implications for 
future work. 
Our study foregrounds that audiences value the novelty of the 
experience and the unfamiliarity of information. Personalization, 
contextualization, and storytelling, mainly using metaphors and 
analogies, are crucial for making data relatable. The experience 
inspired debate and successfully led to conversations. While users 
fnd suggestions for actionable communication highly benefcial, 
they desire more diverse interactivity and closer connections to the 
information. Storytelling techniques, like foregrounding character 
development and live interactions, can deepen user engagement 
and empathy. Still, character consistency and live interactions must 
be carefully planned. This year’s DIS asks "why design?" to "prompt refection on 
the role and power that design has" and "where it can be used to 
engage with contemporary troubles" [107]. We do so by experiment-
ing with interaction strategies to address gaps in climate change 
communication and the importance of HCI and graphic design in 
these exchanges. The insights derived from our study can illumi-
nate designers’ path in hyperobject communication such as climate 
change, advocating for designs that foster meaningful interactions 
and elevate the discourse within the HCI community. 
2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 
This research builds on prior work in sustainable HCI (SHCI) and 
data visualisation. In the following, we summarise i) the recent 
debate around SHCI and its shift towards a focus on climate change, 
ii) Interactive data visualisation approaches in HCI, with a focus on 
climate change-related visualisations, and iii) Data humanism’s ap-
plication within the HCI feld. Our work builds on these recent data 
visualisation approaches and continues their exploration through 
the creation of a data-story that combines data humanism and other 
communication strategies that strive to enhance data interpretation. 
2.1 Sustainable human-computer interaction 
(SHCI) and the shift towards Climate 
Change 
Sustainability should be one of the core focuses of HCI [11]. With 
this premise in mind, the feld of Sustainable HCI (SHCI) has been 
committed to minimizing the environmental impacts of computing 
technologies and infuencing sustainable behaviours [10, 116]. The 
possibilities and responsibilities of the HCI community related to 
sustainability have been debated for years [ 76]. Discussions looked 
at the future implications of integrating sustainable principles into 
current designs [ 11], as well as the potential of moulding possible 
futures connected with the broader societal impact and relevance 
of interaction design [37]. The considerable focus on persuasion 
and its limiting factors have been questioned (e.g. [14]), as well 
as the focus on individual behaviour (e.g. [31]) or on incremental 
instead of systemic change (e.g. [34]). Questions surrounding the 
unsustainability of digital technologies, in particular data-driven 
ones [70], have led researchers to call for “more meaningful” digital 
experiences [113]. Each practice-based SHCI project should clearly 
defne or design specifc sustainability objectives and measurements 
[94], and be transparent about its strategies and materials [111]. 
The Anthropocene presents both obstacles and possibilities, ne-
cessitating innovative viewpoints [5]. Design practitioners are now 
compelled to extend their focus beyond products, incorporating 
services, networks, and experiences which address intricate socio-
technical systems [18]. Such systems prompt a departure from 
conventional design methodologies that primarily concentrate on 
"the human" towards inclusive approaches encompassing a vari-
ety of perspectives. Scholars have argued for the transition from 
a merely user-centered design to posthumanistic views that de-
centers the human in the design process [43]. These take a more 
comprehensive, diverse approach that includes the relations be-
tween human and nonhuman actors [44], multispecies perspectives 
through nonanthropocentric approaches, for example by being in-
spired by natural processes such as decomposition [68], or through 
3030
Towards Relatable Climate Change Data DIS ’24, July 01–05, 2024, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark 
multispecies participatory practices [75] that work towards cohab-
itation [95]. Also, Key[ 58] asks HCI researchers to embrace the 
complexities and uncertainties of posthumanistic work and to chal-
lenge human exceptionalism through “true” design innovation that 
considers these tensions. 
These proposals expand the notion of participation to designing 
with the more-than-human [1]. Civic and participatory design ap-
proaches [22, 29] can link to broader societal issues such as politics 
[29], resistance, and diverse modes of civic engagement [30]. The 
need to empower and support civic and collective action demands 
the design of interactive systems with a strong social component 
[64]. Transition Design [103] emerged as one approach that directly 
considers the complexity of the many wicked problems we face as 
a global society. It promotes a design-led transition towards more 
sustainable futures that is more place-based, participatory and con-
nected to the natural environment [104]. Other approaches, such 
as design futuring [45] and speculative design [97], challenge de-
signers to consider the future of their designs and explore complex 
problems. 
Considering these complex challenges, Knowles and colleagues 
[62] call for the HCI community to orient around climate change 
rather than the more expansive and multidimensional concept of 
"sustainability". This reasoning originates from Klein’s argument 
that climate change ofers a critical unifying narrative that keeps 
us focused on pressing existential issues [61]. Fifteen years after 
the emergence of SHCI, Bremer et al. [13] identifed a shift from 
a focus on individual behaviour change towards the design with 
and for communities (context-oriented) and the increased use of 
speculation and refection instead of prescription. This leads to 
difculty in measuring impact and questioning if opening design 
spaces isn’t passing the responsibility of application and evaluation 
to future researchers. 
Diverse discussions have emerged regarding the strategies of 
SHCI, especially when it comes to addressing climate change. A 
need for meaning, fulfllment and hope in times of existential crisis 
asks designers to question what and how they design as not to add 
to a passive and limited digital landscape [66]. The relationship be-
tween humans and nature has been a topic of extensive debate. For 
instance, Liu et al. [69] propose an alternative framing to the domi-
nant SHCI models of “correction” of human behaviour or “control” 
of resource consumption inspired by permaculture’s philosophy of 
working with nature, emphasising human cooperation instead of 
control. Or Vella et al. [110] explore a deepening of human-nature 
relations through care and curiosity. One of the latest discussions 
around the future of HCI and climate change took place at CHI’23 
[79] with a focus on data communication and public engagement. 
This highlights the open-ended nature of HCI’s role within climate 
change-related interventions, and the growing role of the feld in 
building awareness, inclusion and connection with this complex 
topic. It also points to a need for further exploration in this area of 
work. Therefore, we set out to test communication strategies that 
assisted in decentering the human in the narrative. 
SHCI research can take a toll on those attempting to make an 
impact through their work. The authors of this paper have also 
realised that “we can’t do it all, but we can do something” [13]. 
Bendor [8] argued for hope and designerly action for sustainability, 
saying that "designers are also capable of promoting innovative ways of seeing and being that may evoke agency". Climate leader 
Ayana Elizabeth Johnson [57] proposes that each person focuses 
on their skills and what brings them joy in climate action. We 
focused on our particular expertise, in the case of the frst author: 
communication design, and worked towards making a positive 
contribution through HCI research for better engagement with 
climate change data. 
2.2 Interactive Data Visualisation for Climate 
Change engagement 
Innovative forms of visualising data and storytelling through digital 
media can infuence the public’s understanding of climate change 
topics [50]. One of the proposals by Mankof et al. [76] for research 
in Sustainability through Design was “making abstract environ-
mental data concrete for everyday life”. When looking specifcally 
at climate change, recent studies analyzing a decade’s worth of HCI 
and design research suggest that a majority of interaction projects 
transmit an impartial message without any explicit call to action 
[39, 40]. The research suggests an opportunity for selecting lesser-
known subjects, integrating inclusive viewpoints and actionable 
suggestions, adapting the message to the audience and taking the 
experience to "where the user is". 
Considering these implications and recent climate change com-
munication guidelines that call for a focus on stories, communities, 
day-to-day experiences and link to action [21, 24, 82], we focus on 
HCI research that explores strategies outside the majority’s neu-
tral framing and lack of suggestions for action, demonstrating the 
feld’s recent explorations within these approaches. RisingEMO-
TIONS [3] utilized emotions and community connection to commu-
nicate the dangers associated with rising sea levels. The community 
was engaged in critical discussions through public interventions 
that guided them towards future action by connecting to local 
groups [84]. Similarly, Smart Citizen [84] connects communities to 
local services with positive results, highlighting sustainability is-
sues, and fostering citizen participation via engaging location-based 
experiences. Other projects use data physicalisations of environ-
mental data to elicit collective sense-making and carbon literacy 
[67] or link to citizens’ subjective experiences to foster community 
building and activism [28]. These two projects highlight the impor-
tance of alternative ways of representing “invisible” environmental 
data and the importance of collective critical engagement in these 
complex dialogues. Ecorbis [99] deployed in home settings, uses 
a data sculpture to promote environmental awareness relating to 
user behaviour, and ofer actionable facts, raising awareness and fa-
cilitating refection. Saving Aid [98] underscores the importance of 
data framing in supporting energy conservation decisions. Adding 
a personal touch, More Weather Tomorrow [108] uses a personal-
ized data video story narrated as a weather forecast to encourage 
families to explore weather data collectively. The study establishes 
a link between data and memories to boost engagement. The im-
portance of relating to personal contexts and experiences in data 
exploration is also analysed by [114]. To create awareness about 
drought and wildfres, [50] created a data visualisation depicting 
the past, present and future of wildfres, highlighting the positive 
efects of multimodal interaction.

As these examples show, HCI research on visualizing climate 
change data is diverse, the concern generally being enhancing 
engagement and understanding of the information. Furthering these 
approaches within climate change engagement is crucial. Good 
practices used in UX, graphic design and psychology can inform 
the development of more efective visualisations related to climate 
change data, as these still need to be made more inclusive to non-
expert audiences [102]. Considering climate data’s complexity and 
often global and abstract nature, communication strategies such 
as narrative and connection to user experiences should be further 
explored for better data engagement. According to Soden [96], we 
need to carefully consider our choices about what we include or 
exclude from our environmental data sets and how we use them. 
They dictate how we abstract the environment and our relationship 
with it, leading to possibilities of “things to be otherwise”. 
2.3 Data Humanism in HCI Research 
The optimal method for illustrating complex data to non-expert 
audiences is still a point of contention [78]. For the past thirty years, 
preeminent authors in data visualisation have heavily emphasized 
design efcacy and straightforward communication, in what can be 
called a "neutrality" concept [117]. Tufte argues for a clutter-free 
approach that primarily showcases the raw data [105], in line with 
other proposals that underscore the importance of precision and 
comprehensibility for swift communication [42], cautioning against 
the manipulative misuse of data visualisation [16]. 
McCandless has proposed a storytelling approach that consists 
of four key elements: data (information), concept (story), function 
(goal), and metaphor (visual form) [77]. Storytelling has become 
increasingly pivotal in data visualisation design, transitioning from 
a neutral showcase of information to more humanistic depictions 
capable of demonstrating ambiguity and complexity. These ap-
proaches recognize that data is neither value-neutral nor indepen-
dent of the observer [36]. Since 2016, Lupi [71] has advocated a 
paradigm shift in data visualisation that challenges conventional 
rules, such as striving for simplicity. This new approach, named 
data humanism, explores alternative chart types and invites au-
diences to take their time and appreciate the visualisations [86]. 
These approaches consider the subjectivity of data and its connec-
tion to people’s understanding and experiences. Within HCI and 
data science, Strohmayer and Muller [100] recently debated the 
subjectivity of data sets, and how people shape the data through 
their analysis and how they use it. 
Data humanism doesn’t conform to the typical ’simplicity’ prin-
ciple and instead explores non-traditional chart types that embrace 
complexity, incorporate context, and recognize data’s inherent 
imperfection and subjectivity. These compelling and customized 
data-driven visual narratives intend to bridge the gap between 
numbers and their real-life meaning: stories, knowledge, people, 
and behaviours [71, 73]. This is achieved by integrating layers of 
qualitative information with the quantitative data, adding context 
and meaning [74], and therefore creating an intimate connection 
through relatable concepts [72]. These principles align with recent 
climate engagement communication guidelines that call for making 
climate data "relatable, local and personal" [82]. The concept of ’making with data’ has taken diverse forms within 
HCI – from data sonifcation (using sound parameters) to data edibi-
lization (using edible materials) to data physicalisation (an artifact 
that encodes data), among others [81]. Several innovative data repre-
sentation approaches share goals or concepts with data humanism. 
Storytelling augments data representation and meaning [ 88], and 
strategic interactive elements engage in data exploration [93]. In 
terms of environmental data, eco-feedback experiences manifest en-
ergy and sustainability-related data, especially in residential [7, 85] 
or communal settings [9]. Projects like Indoor Weather Stations [49] 
and Energy Babble [47] explore the physicalization of environmen-
tal data. By exploring location, [48] introduced external data into 
the home, while [46] related users to "big data" about their areas – 
connecting users to somewhat abstract or intricate data, bringing it 
into everyday contexts. Data physicalization [52, 56] assists in un-
derstanding data via physical depictions to enhance refection and 
public engagement [4]. Similarly, tangible user interfaces (TUI) en-
able users to interact with digital data via physical objects [53, 106]. 
Both strategies engage audiences with intricate data, particularly in 
public spaces [54], and can facilitate emotional responses, refection, 
and memorability despite data translation subjectivity [112]. 
Data humanism shares commonalities with these established HCI 
disciplines. However, we argue that this approach can contribute to 
novel avenues within HCI data visualisations and data narratives, 
particularly within complex subjects like climate change. Whether 
in two or three-dimensional form, data humanism avoids over-
simplifcation and prioritizes aesthetics, exploration, storytelling, 
and a deep connection to emotional and personal values, enabling 
a transition of data ownership to people. Inspired by the latter 
point, Kim et al. [59] used personal data collection and depiction 
for self-refection and engagement. Similar techniques were used in 
educational contexts [15, 63], and with marginalized communities 
[60, 87]. Houben et al. [55] humanized the exchange by merging 
qualitative and quantitative data in a public display, while Sauvé 
and Houben [92] focused on data visualisation tools for laypersons 
to inspire action. Angulo et al. [2] applied data humanism in an 
interactive infographic game about sustainable food. Other studies 
[59, 89] used personalization through bespoke visuals to enhance 
engagement. 
These HCI projects underscore the importance of connecting 
non-specialist audiences with data through less ’neutral’ and more 
engaging methods, opposing the traditional research focus on a 
limited variety of visualisation types [ 78]. However, to the best of 
our knowledge, no other HCI research has applied data human-
ism to climate change-related visualisations outside of our recent 
contribution as part of this work [41]. The importance of action-
able communication and engagement with climate change topics 
through positive stories that link to action, communities and per-
sonal values is fundamental [26, 82]. Therefore, data humanism 
emerged as a promising communication strategy to test. Interactive 
systems that allow for easy update, personalization, engaging and 
participatory experiences can assist in the crucial task of creating 
more diverse narratives associated with climate change [17, 35, 101] 
and meaningfully engage diverse audiences with this complex data. 
These experiences can lead to urgently needed dialogues [6, 65].

Our work is set to contribute to the gap in Climate change commu-
nication and HCI by exploring how data humanism can assist in 
these urgent pursuits. 
3 METHODOLOGY 
In response to HCI’s call for innovative approaches in climate 
change communication, this study advances an empirical contribu-
tion by describing the design of an interactive artefact centred on 
the ocean ecosystem and carbon sequestration. By drawing inspi-
ration from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) study on the 
signifcance of whales in ocean health [20], we designed a compre-
hensive story embedded with ocean-related data, paving the way 
for deeper human-data interaction and advancing the HCI feld 
for climate change communication. The following describes the 
concept, design decisions, and study methodology. 
3.1 Author Positionality 
This section points to challenges that arise from tackling such a 
complex topic as climate change and how the author’s individual 
perspectives and lived experiences can infuence the work. 
Living in a Southern European country, the authors’ personal 
contact with the consequences of climate change is limited, and we 
acknowledge our privileged position. This research was conducted 
in Europe, and the authors’ social and geographical networks are in 
the global North. This context plays a signifcant role in shaping our 
understanding of climate change, even if we strive to have a global 
understanding of the issue. The frst author, therefore, focused her 
work in the contexts that are familiar to her, both in the audience 
and in the focus of the research. 
The frst author is a communication designer interested in en-
vironmental engagement, collaborating with a multidisciplinary 
team of engineers, designers, and psychologists. These intellectual 
afliations have infuenced the direction of the work, the language 
incorporated in the research, and the themes highlighted during 
the analysis. 
Considering this positionality, the artefact and the study method-
ology focus on visualisation/communication strategies and users’ 
perceptions and feelings toward the information. 
3.2 Designing Finding Arcadia (FA) 
The design process of FA follows our Data Humanism RtD frame-
work proposed in [41] and extends on other previous work we 
presented in [40] by: 
(1) Stressing the importance of actionable communication; 
(2) Incorporating audience-targeted interactions; 
(3) Taking these experiences to public, everyday spaces; 
(4) Engagement with underexplored topics; and 
(5) Ofering an inclusive narrative. 
FA went through several design iterations, informed by co-design 
sessions with experts – the ocean data was validated in consulta-
tion with a marine biologist; the communication and interaction 
strategies were iterated based on the feedback of several HCI and 
storytelling experts. A couple of studies, in a science museum and 
at a local market, shaped the study design and refnements to the 
experience. The details of these previous processes, design deci-
sions and iterations are discussed in [41]. With this study, we delve deeper into the communication features and focus on understand-
ing user perception and relation with the data. FA proposes a shift 
from merely nudging to deeply understanding users’ connections 
to data, moving "from ‘nudge’ to ‘think’ as a strategy for public 
engagement" by "engaging hearts and minds" [21]. 
To achieve this, we designed two versions of the artefact: a 
Base version (vB) and an Enhanced version (vE) improved with 
the communication strategies selected. Both versions implement 
some of the guidelines mentioned by [40], namely i) focusing on a 
non-obvious topic (whales as a nature-based solution for carbon 
capturing), ii) displaying the information in a public space of pas-
sage, and iii) focusing on including proposals for action. However, 
while both versions retain similar structure and graphical elements, 
they difer signifcantly in data presentation. 
The Base version (vB) is data-focused and the data is lacking 
in comparative or personalized nuances (Fig.3 – B.1, B.2), detailed 
below in vE. This version does not explore storytelling strategies – 
the data is reported in an impersonal third-person manner through 
a human voice narrator. Interactions are limited to basic fipping. 
The Enhanced version (vE) uses diverse communication strate-
gies to foster relatability (Fig.2 and 3). The employed communica-
tion strategies are: 
(1) Data humanism: Through contextualization and person-
alization of the data applied with user-specifc adaptability. 
For instance, users can input their birth year, prompting the 
system to adjust the visualisation and provide a relevant 
fact from that year about climate change or sustainability 
(Fig.3 – vE.1). Another example is users being able to input 
their height and compare it to a whale’s size. Also, context 
is added through comparisons to familiar metrics like juxta-
posing the carbon sequestration of whales with that of trees 
or equating it to a user’s national emissions (Fig.3 – vE.2) 
(2) Storytelling: Use of storytelling conventions and features, 
such as character development and basic plotting of the 
whale life journey, according to the IMF whale life cycle [20]. 
The data throughout the story is reported in the frst person 
by Baltazar (Fig.2 – vE), the personifed whale, who tells the 
audience his life story. The data shown is intertwined with 
Baltazar’s story – from birth to adulthood, when he narrates 
his benefts to the environment and climate change mitiga-
tion, but also when faces the threats of the Anthropocene, to 
his death of old age and how even this stage of his existence 
is benefcial to the environment. 
(3) Decentering the human in the narrative: FA centres the 
discourse around the more-than-human, fostering a con-
nection of humans with a global ecosystem. Exploring a 
non-human protagonist and highlighting whales’ carbon-
capturing processes casts them as iconic symbols of nature 
preservation and under-estimated but hopeful nature-based 
solutions for climate change. We strived to be accurate with 
the data but also mindful of the unknown factors surround-
ing these entities (e.g., the marine biologist suggested several 
editions to adjust the narrative to these unknowns). We em-
ployed a Large Language Model (LLM) to breathe life into 
"Baltazar" and enrich the narrative. Our prompt asked the 
model to personify a blue whale and recount the data "facts"

of vB through his frst-person perspective (Fig.2). Besides the 
narration, we also used the LLM to allow users to "chat" with 
Baltazar at the end of the experience (Fig.3 – vE.4). These 
narrative strategies were designed to amplify empathy and 
deepen user connection with the data through another tool 
to further explore the content. Some limitations of these 
approaches are debated in the Discussion as we acknowl-
edge the challenge of representing more-than-human enti-
ties through these human-made features and perspectives. 
(4) Positive framing: Highlighting positive aspects in the data 
(Fig. 3 – vE.1) and linking to action (Fig.3 – vE.3) to inspire a 
hopeful outlook on climate change, focused on solutions and 
connection of the individual and the community with the en-
vironment. This version ofers personalized solution sugges-
tions based on users’ existing practices (collected throughout 
the interaction with the artefact). The narrative concludes 
with a summary of potential areas of contribution specifc 
to each participant. 
3.3 Participants Recruitment and Demographics 
To understand the impact of the chosen strategies, we conducted 
an in-the-wild study comparing the two artefact versions, vB and 
vE. The two versions were set up sequentially in the same public 
space – the atrium of a Creative Hub, where businesses, research 
and innovation centres reside (Fig.1). Capitalizing on this public 
location, we casually approached Hub residents and passers-by 
for participation. Furthermore, we promoted the installation with 
the local community via email and social media channels. The 
recruiting phase lasted one week. 
Before starting the experience, participants were given an overview 
of the study, including that it consisted of evaluating the artefact and 
not themselves and that they could withdraw at any time without 
consequences. They were then asked to sign a consent form where 
all this information was detailed, and the researcher’s contacts 
were listed. This study only engaged with adult participants (over 
eighteen years old). Besides age, there were no other disqualifying 
criteria. 
In total, the study engaged 42 individuals. Participants age distri-
bution is as follows: 18-24 (n=10); 25-34 (n=12); 35-44 (N=15); 45-54 
(n=5). Twenty-one users identifed as female, nineteen as male, and 
two preferred not to say. Their education level is distributed as 
Middle and Secondary School (n=5); Bachelor and Master degree 
(n=22); and Postgraduate (n=15). 
3.4 Procedure and Methods 
The study (N=42) occurred over four consecutive days, Monday to 
Thursday. The frst author oversaw the study and conducted the 
interviews. The study was divided into four stages. 
First, the user answered a questionnaire about their demographic 
information (age, gender, and education level) and prior under-
standing and relation to climate change topics. Participants were 
individually assigned to alternate artefact versions (vB or vE). The 
overall experience took c. 5 minutes for vB and c. 10 minutes for vE. 
Secondly, after the experience, the user would answer a question-
naire adapted from the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory’s (IMI) Inter-
est/Enjoyment, Value/Usefulness, and Relatedness scales [90, 91]. The questions were selected to assess feelings of interest, usefulness, and 
relatability towards the data, providing a base comparison between 
the two versions. The three sets of seven questions each (Fig.4) 
were randomly ordered and answered on a scale of 1 – Strongly 
disagree to 5 – Strongly agree. Thirdly, we conducted a short inter-
view (c. 4 minutes), further probing the three engagement aspects 
explored in the questionnaire and feedback on the strategies used. 
All participants went through the complete data-story and replied 
to the questionnaire and the open interview, resulting in forty-two 
valid answers, twenty-one for each artefact version (vB users: S.B1 
to S.B21; and vE users: S.E1 to S.E21). 
Lastly, after six months of engaging with the data-story, a subsec-
tion of participants (N=19) was probed with an online questionnaire 
– nine vB users (F.B1 to F.B9) and ten vE users (F.E1 to F.E10). This 
follow-up aimed to probe users’ remembrance of the data, pos-
sible changes in perception or habits, and overall relation to the 
topic. This follow-up half a year later was performed to gain more 
longitudinal insights into the impact of the experience and the 
communication strategies used, as suggested by [3]. The online 
questionnaire was chosen for its ease of deployment and minimal 
impact on participant’s lives. Participants were selected based on 
their voluntary availability to further engage with the study and 
answer the questionnaire. The survey questions were designed to 
provide further data to discuss against the original feedback. Below 
is a sample of the questions asked: 
• Since you did the experience, have you been more attentive 
to any topic or issue? If yes, which ones? 
• Were you motivated to take any action or change any habit? 
If yes, what changed? If not, why? 
• Did you feel connected with the information/story? Why? 
One researcher analysed the quantitative output of the scales, 
while another researcher analysed the qualitative interviews and 
questionnaires. Results were discussed and agreed upon among all 
authors, sharing insights and points of view to shape the discussion 
and contribution of the study. 
3.5 Sustainability Considerations 
In line with our commitment to sustainable research and given the 
ongoing discussions surrounding SHCI’s role and obligations, we 
report on the sustainability measures adopted during this study’s 
design phase. 
While our research delves into sustainability-related topics, we 
acknowledge our systems’ inherent material and energy consump-
tion. On the energy front, the venue of our study uses solar energy 
to a certain extent. Nevertheless, we remain contingent on exter-
nalities. Going forward, it’s pivotal that lab policies take on a more 
autonomous and adaptable approach towards fueling our digital 
outputs. 
Focusing on the installation’s physical aspect, the public dis-
play’s principal frame is predominantly crafted from upcycled plas-
tic, excluding components like screws, wheels, and screen-mount. 
This material was procured from a nearby enterprise specializing 
in repurposing plastic for outdoor constructs. Notably, the adorn-
ments can be removed, allowing the structure’s reuse in subsequent 
projects and as a lab fxture. Pre-existing lab resources like the

ing the need for new acquisitions for this project. 
4 FINDINGS FROM THE STUDY 
In this section, we present the results from our mixed methods study, 
consisting of: i) the analysis of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory 
(IMI) scales [90, 91] (quantitative), ii) the qualitative analysis of the 
semi-structured interviews, and fnally, iii) the qualitative analysis 
of the post-experience questionnaire. 
4.1 Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) scales 
Responses from the IMI questionnaire were organized in a table and 
analyzed using the IMI scale [90, 91] (Fig.4), with average scores per 
question and total per scale, per version of the artefact. Answers 
were given on a scale of 1 – Strongly disagree to 5 - Strongly agree. 
The questionnaire’s Interest/Enjoyment scale results are positive 
for both versions of the artefact, with 4.56 (vB), and 4.58 (vE) on 
a 1 to 5 scale. These results indicate that users perceived both 
experiences as enjoyable and interesting. 
The results for the Relatedness scale indicating relatability to the 
data were also high for both versions: vB scored 4.41, while vE 
scored 4.46. 
Finally, the Value/ Usefulness scale questionnaire results point to 
users seeing the information as useful. vB scored 4.13, and vE had 
a slight edge with a score of 4.36. 
4.2 Semi-structured Interviews 
The interviews were thematically analyzed according to [12]. To 
address the study’s exploratory aim, the frst author started by 
coding the interviews through utterances that indicated: a) users’ 
interest in the data, b) users’ relatability with the data, and c) users’ 
expressions about the usefulness of the data. Following the data 
coding, all authors discussed and agreed on clustering the infor-
mation into higher-level themes. In the following, we present the 
themes highlighted in this analysis. 
4.2.1 Novelty of the Topic – Ocean/Whales Data. 
The theme of Ocean/Whales Data as a topic of interest was men-
tioned by most users (n=40). These comments were frequently 
linked to the novelty of the data: “I didn’t know that whales ab-
sorbed carbon and that this infuenced global warming. ” (S.B5); “The 
CO2 part, how much the whale takes with it. It was new. ” (S.E7). The 
data-story added perspective to more frequently explored topics: 
“I thought because with cows, for example, they also output a lot of 
CO2. So I was surprised that other animals are, like, actually helpful. ” 
(S.B16). 
4.2.2 Novelty of the Output/Context – Interactive Public Installa-
tion. 
Likewise, users also positively remarked on the Originality of the In-
stallation : “It was quite creative. I had never interacted with anything 
like this before. . . ” (S.E19); “I think there should be more applications 
like this. ” (S.E8);“Maybe the walls, the object [the installation]. It’s, 
for me, a very diferent object. ” (S.B7). One user focused specifcally 
on how climate change is being communicated: “The issue of com-
municating these issues interactively in a common space. It has to be 
done and it is not being done. ” (S.B4). 4.2.3 Engagement through Interactive Features. 
Most users commented that they liked the Interactive Features. How-
ever, the two versions were perceived diferently. The three users 
from vB discussed what they enjoyed about the communication 
by focusing on the interactive features: the ability to control what 
they read (S.B12, S.B17), and the relation of the narration with the 
interactive elements (S.B16) – “I liked those little pieces of paper that 
were rotating and I think it was really cool. I only see it if I want to. ” 
(S.B12). On the other hand, comments from users of vE focus on the 
communication of information being well presented (S.E14, S.E15), 
immersive (S.E4), and leading to better understanding (S.E8, S.E19, 
S.E20). These features led them to want to explore or know more 
(S.E4, S.E13). For example: “I think what is being looked for here is a 
way to captivate more and interact more and not just show numbers 
and things like that. (...) I think it makes the data more immersive. ” 
(S.E4). 
Diferences related to perceived interest were noted between the 
two versions when discussing data presentation features, with vE 
users linking the interactive features to a deeper sense of engage-
ment and curiosity. 
4.2.4 Relatability  Through the Overall Experience. 
The interview analysis resulted in 64 comments connected to relata-
bility with the data, with most of the comments being from users 
of vE (n=40), compared with vB (n=24). 
Users from vB felt the data was made relatable through a variety 
of features: the Information (n=3); Suggestions for action (n=3); Audio 
narration (n=2); Narration and visuals (n=2); General interactivity 
(n=2) or the Visuals (n=2). In general, these comments tend towards 
generic aspects, such as the relation with the climate topic and its 
relevance nowadays, the narration as an important factor to connect 
them to the data, or seeing the proposals for action as a connection 
thread to their day-to-day. Interactivity and the visuals are also 
commented upon, but users do not describe what they particularly 
enjoyed about these aspects. Nevertheless, these features efectively 
made the data relatable, as shown by the scale results. 
Users (S.B7 and S.B9) also appreciated the metaphor of whales 
as foating trees. This points to the importance of metaphors and 
analogies to assist users in interpreting the meaning of the numbers. 
4.2.5 Relatability Through Personalization and Contextualization. 
Comments by users of vE when replying to what made the data 
relatable cluster around three main themes: Personalization (n=15); 
Contextualization (n=7); and the Visuals (n=7). Here we see a clear 
contrast with vB answers described in the previous section. Two of 
these three themes are based on data humanism principles. We sep-
arated the comments into Personalization and Contextualization, 
but to note some of these comments relate simultaneously to both 
features. These clusters are followed by General interactivity (n=4), 
Audio narration (n=2), Suggestions for action (n=1), and the Infor-
mation (n=1). Finally, two comments say it wasn’t any particular 
aspect but the Experience or story as a whole. 
Personalization features were mentioned as the most compelling. 
Certain expressions highlight the user’s positive reactions to these 
features: “that’s cool, because the information is surprising (...) I 
wasn’t expecting it” (S.E3). Some comments illustrate a deeper and 
more personal connection with the data, as one user puts it “by 
introducing these personal elements, you apprehend the information 
3037
DIS ’24, July 01–05, 2024, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark Ferreira, et al. 
Figure 4: Table with questionnaire results for the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scales [90, 91], with average scores per question 
and total per scale, per version of the artefact. Answers were given on a scale of 1 – Strongly disagree to 5 - Strongly agree. 
in an even deeper way. ” (S.E15). These features assisted in putting 
the data into perspective by comparing it to themselves: “and the 
date of birth part gives you a point of comparison with yourself. ” 
(S.E14); “The fact that it also asks for our input helps us relate to the 
information that is on the screen. Because, like, when we have to put 
our height, for example, our year of birth, it’s like it forces us to create 
a relationship with the information. ” (S.E15). Likewise, by making 
the user part of the data-story: “Putting in your data, I think it helps 
you relate. (. . . ) It’s about connecting you and what is being said. ” 
(S.E10); “The elements that have to do with me, that is, age, height, 
which in some way bring me more into the information. ” (S.E3). 
Users mention contextualization as helping to give meaning to 
the numbers: “I think that visualizing the numbers, for example, 
visualizing the size of the whale, it’s interesting to have an idea of 
what 30 meters are compared to a bus. ” (S.E9). Contextualization also 
assisted in showing new angles about the topic: “Yes, puts things into 
perspective. We don’t live isolated and are in an ecosystem. ” (S.E8); 
“Contextualization. That is, given global numbers, for example, CO2 
emissions, how could this help?” (S.E15). 
4.2.6 Lack of Connection with the Data. 
To note is the clustering of users to whom nothing connected them 
to the information (n=7), mostly from vB (n=6): [feeling connected 
to the data] “No, nothing that specifc. ” (S.B8). Three users from vB 
point to the importance of storytelling in relating to the data and 
the Experience or story as a whole being the reason for a relation 
with the information, not a particular feature: “I don’t know, there’s 
no special part. I liked the graphics, I liked the colours. ” (S.B14). 
Throughout the interviews, some users made suggestions for 
improvements to the experience. Notably, users from vB pointed to the need for strategies that made them closer to the information, 
through comparisons to other metrics – e.g. “When you say 33 tons 
(...) it’s such a big number. That’s the same as, like, however many 
thousand? Compared to some more relatable number.” (S.B6) – or 
linking to more personal issues – e.g. “There was nothing special 
that made me put myself there. ” (S.B3). 
These clusters highlight a clear diference between vB and vE, 
with a subset of users, almost exclusively from vB, commenting on 
a lack of connection with the data and suggesting improvements 
for better relatability. 
4.2.7 Data Perceived as Useful. 
The coding process resulted in three main clusters for “degrees of 
usefulness” derived from users seeing the information as: 1) Not 
particularly useful; 2) Somewhat useful; and 3) Useful. 
Most users thought the information was useful to them (n=22) – 
vB n=9, vE n=13. We grouped them into fve themes: i) Suggestions 
for Action with users (n=7) fnding suggestions useful for their 
daily lives; ii) users (n=6) associated usefulness with Information 
about the ocean and whales – for example, giving a holistic sense of 
environmental issues or being surprised by the importance of these 
marine ecosystems; iii) users (n=4) who Learned new information 
or gained a new perspective ; iv) Reinforcing current knowledge or 
actions (n=3); v) users (n=2) who found the information Good to 
know in general. All users but one from vB fall within the frst (n=3) 
or second (n=5) clusters, while users from vE are more distributed, 
again showing more heterogeneous responses. 
A few vB users didn’t think the information was particularly 
useful for two main reasons: i) already being familiar with the 
information (n=3); and ii) feeling disconnected from it (n=1): “This is 
3038
Towards Relatable Climate Change Data DIS ’24, July 01–05, 2024, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark 
a lot of things I already knew and things I already do in my daily life. 
So it’s not useful, for me personally, not. ” (S.B3). 
The remaining users (n=16) fell in the middle, fnding the in-
formation useful to a certain degree. The majority (n=9) replied 
that they Already knew the information (or most of it), but they still 
think it is useful or they still learned something. The remaining 
users thought the information linked to Current behaviour (n=3) or 
was Useful with limitations (n=4). These limitations were mostly 
connected to fnding the proposals for action insufcient or with a 
limited range. 
4.2.8 Actionable Suggestions for Daily Life. 
Connected to data usefulness, another cluster highlights sugges-
tions for action users mentioned throughout the interviews. Forty-
fve comments mentioned actionable communication. The themes 
highlighted the following: Fibres (n=12); Plastic/Recycling (n=12); 
Consumption (n=9); Transportation (n=5); Ocean tourism (n=4); Food 
(n=2); and Energy (n=2). 
Users from vE commented on "actions" more often (n=31) than 
users from vB (n=15), focusing on “useful” suggestions, i.e. actions 
to improve (n=33) when compared to mentions of actions users 
already do or feel are hard to implement (n=13). This result aligns 
with seeing the interactive artefact overall as useful and connected 
to users’ daily lives: “Yes, of course. Reinforcing. The information you 
already knew and, above all, try to continue to change habits. ” (S.E6); 
“Yes. So there are some tips that people can, actions that they can take 
in their lives. These are easy things. ” (S.E9). 
4.3 Engagement with the AI Live Dialogue 
Feature 
The end of vE included the possibility of initiating dialogue with 
the main whale character, Baltazar, through an LLM. Seven of the 
twenty-one users actively used the “chat with Baltazar” feature. 
However, none of the users mentioned this particular feature in the 
interviews. Users asked ffteen questions, eight were related to the 
information in the story – e.g. “How much CO2 do you have in your 
body?” (S.E15); “How many incidents occur a year because of collision 
routes between whales and ships?” (S.E8). One regarded whales in 
general – “Do whales have predators? ” (S.E9) – while four connected 
to Baltazar – e.g. “How are you?” (S.E7); “How old are you?” (S.E19). 
The remaining two questions were grouped as “Exploratory” as we 
saw them as users testing the system’s creativity – “Who is your 
creator?” (S.E9); “What is whale heaven like?” (S.E13). 
4.4 Post-experience Questionnaire 
4.4.1 Ocean/Whale Data Recollection. 
Nearly all of the nineteen users mentioned whale or ocean data 
(n=16), generating 28 comments expressing interest, especially in 
interspecies relations (vB n=5, vE n=4): "I pay more attention to the 
marine environment and the relationship between the ocean and 
me. " (F.B6); and the carbon/oxygen cycle (vB n=2, vE n=5): "I think 
of whales when talking about carbon capture. " (F.E4). Comments 
highlighted increased marine environment awareness and whale 
empathy, along with whales’ positive impact on CO2 consumption. 
Other topics included whale ecosystem benefts (vB n=2, vE n=3) 
and human impacts on climate change (vE n=3). 4.4.2 Atentiveness to Topics/Issues. 
Eight users reported no change in attentiveness post-experience 
(vB n=5, vE n=3), while eleven users noted an increased focus on 
whale/ocean topics (vB n=1, vE n= 3): "I became very curious about 
the role played by whales in helping circulate nutrients in the ocean. " 
(F.E8); actions (vB n=1, vE n=3): "Yes, especially regarding buying 
clothes with the less amount possible of polyester." (F.B4); and the 
topic in general (vB n=2, vE n=1): "I have been more attentive to news 
about climate change. " (F.E7). 
vB users mostly reported no increased attentiveness, with a few 
citing general topics. In contrast, attentive vE users mostly focused 
on specifc issues like whale/ocean conservation and actions, show-
ing a diference in engagement between the two groups. 
4.4.3 Data Relevance . 
Most users found the information generally relevant (vB n=8, vE 
n=7): "Yes, it is always relevant to understand the impact of life on life. " 
(F.B8). A few connected it personally to their actions or awareness 
(vB n=1, vE n=3), though without specifying individual connections: 
"Yes defnitely, even if only to make me aware of this topic. " (F.B4). 
The diference between the two versions is subtle, with users of vE 
showing a slightly more pronounced tendency to mention more 
personal reasons. 4.4.4 Connection 
 with the Data. 
Most users reported feeling connected to the information or story 
(n=16), with only three exceptions (vB n=1, vE n=2). Four attributed 
their engagement to the compelling narrative and visual elements 
(vB n=2, vE n=2). Three users had a previous connection with the 
themes presented (vB n=1, vE n=2), while three others were drawn 
to specifc content such as whale and ecosystem information (vB 
n=2, vE n=1). Personal connections were also mentioned, including 
how the information related to actions proposed (vB n=1): "I think 
some of the more concrete examples were very easy to map into my 
day-to-day life, it helped me feel connected. " (F.B2); geographical 
connections (vB n=1, vE n=1): "Above all, the Portuguese connection to 
whaling and, more recently, tourism associated with whale watching. " 
(F.E4); and the personalization features of the story (vE=1): "Yes, 
especially when they ask about age, height and weight and put us in 
context with the history of whales and create empathy with this type 
of animal. " (F.E3). 
Besides the two vE users that specifcally mention more personal 
metrics, there is no clear diference between the two versions. 4.4.5 Inspire
  Action. 
Nine users reported no habit changes post-experience, seven at-
tributing this to already sustainable habits (F.B5, 6, 8; F.E6, 9), lack of 
new actionable insights (F.E4), or perceived lack of infuence (F.B3, 
F.E6). Two users felt the experience reinforced existing behaviours 
(F.B2; F.E3). Eight users did note changes or heightened attention 
to behaviours: "The use of plastic in clothes and in other unexpected 
places. " (F.E2); "I’ve paid particular attention to anything related to 
food or all sorts of product consumption for a while." (F.E8). These 
actions were categorised as: Consumerism (F.B4, 7; F.E2, 8); Plastic in 
Fabrics (F.B4, F.E2, 10); Water Pollution ((F.E1, 8); Food (F.E8), Waste 
(F.E7), and Knowledge (F.B8). 
4.4.6 Motivating  Conversations. 
Five users did not discuss their experience afterwards (vB n=3; 
3039
DIS ’24, July 01–05, 2024, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark Ferreira, et al. 
vE n=2), citing reasons such as lack of opportunity (F.B6, F.E5), 
not remembering (F.E9), or simply not having engaged in such 
conversations (F.B1, 9). In contrast, the majority did engage in 
discussions – three with colleagues (F.B3, 5; F.E3) and the remaining 
talking about the information to friends and family (F.B2, 4, 7; F.E1, 
2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10): "I did share some more curious aspects of it with 
my family. " (F.B7); "I remember talking to my sister about the thing 
that we learned from having the whale die. " (F.E6); "With friends and 
family about microplastics. " (F.E10). 
5 DISCUSSION 
With the present research, the authors extend on the call to rally 
around the complexity of climate change [62], and the need for 
diverse solutions and perspectives. Echoing Han and Khanduja 
[50], we also “believe new ways of visualizing data and storytelling 
with new media technology will have an impact on the public for their 
better understanding of climate change”. The current study examines 
specifc communication strategies through HCI for climate change 
engagement, investigating their potential to enhance understanding 
and connection with a hyperobject. 
Results from the IMI scales were cross-referenced with the in-
terviews and post-experience questionnaires to evaluate the pro-
gressive infuence of data humanism, storytelling, decentering the 
human in the narrative, and positive framing in interactions with cli-
mate change data. While both artefacts scored similarly on the IMI 
scales, the interviews and post-experience questionnaires pointed 
to key diferences between the two versions. In the following, we 
discuss this analysis, the highlighted tensions, and research implica-
tions for the design of engaging climate change-related interactions 
that bridge complex and often impersonal data with lay audiences. 
Building on recent SIGCHI debates [79], we further the HCI dis-
course with climate change by exploring novel communication 
design approaches. 
5.1 Engagement and Dialogues by Going 
Beyond Presenting Facts 
We built on the implications for design proposed by [39] derived 
from gaps found in previous climate change interactions. Our study 
results point to these implications assisting in generating curios-
ity and engagement with the experience. The interview results 
support the outcome of the IMI scale in picking interest in both 
versions of the artefact. As demonstrated by [3], engaging users 
in less-explored contexts was highlighted as relevant. The unex-
pected placement of the interactive physical installation in a public 
setting triggered a sense of curiosity that helped with engagement. 
Likewise, the clustering around the topic’s novelty points to an 
enhanced engagement through this less-known subject. It also high-
lights the importance of presenting less familiar information when 
discussing climate change. 
Results from the interviews and questionnaire suggest that users 
from vE had a deeper interest in the information through positive 
framing and a more-than-human narrative. Linking lay audiences 
with climate change data through emotional engagement has been 
successfully explored in HCI, despite the challenge of balancing ac-
curate data and visual presentation [3]. We navigated these tensions 
by presenting the data and the consequences of the Anthropocene through a nature-focused lens, positive framing and a story of 
resilience. 
The number of users who mentioned having conversations with 
friends and family after the experience was particularly encourag-
ing to show engagement. It is noteworthy that most of these users 
are from vE. This result validates the apparent enhanced interest in 
the data shown by vE users in the interviews. Building on previous 
research that worked towards enhancing engagement with envi-
ronmental data through community [3, 28, 67, 84] or more personal 
[99, 108] connections, our work points to possibilities for HCI re-
search to help address much-needed conversations about climate 
change in our everyday [6]. We created a story beyond data as 
numbers by adding context and creating an emotional connection 
with what was being showcased. 
5.2 Towards Human-Scaled Climate Change Interactions 
The scale and complexity of climate change – a hyperobject [80] – 
makes it difcult to connect to our daily experiences. The challenge 
becomes presenting it on a relatable human scale that transforms 
it from overwhelming phenomena to solvable problems where 
we feel we have some agency to afect change. Throughout this 
study, we explored the importance of "humanising" the data by 
linking complex data sets to local contexts and personal experiences, 
aligning with recent climate change communication guidelines that 
call for making climate data "relatable, local and personal" [82]. 
Our study showed that making climate data more relatable by 
personalizing the interaction and linking it to individual experi-
ences can enhance engagement. The interview’s qualitative insights 
point to vE leading to stronger data relatability thanks to the more 
contextualised data (e.g. personalised and situated metrics). Users 
commented on the efectiveness of seeing how the data related 
directly to their own lives. This approach to data interactions leads 
to a meaningful experience for the user [113]. 
Likewise, the suggestions for improvements to the experience by 
vB users highlight the importance of data humanization, creating 
connections between the person, their experiences, and the data. 
Data humanism has the potential to enhance data connections and 
assist in communicating a hyperobject in a manageable scale, but 
post-experience results suggest that further exploration is needed 
to extend it to longer-term engagement. 
The feedback by users six months later shows limited diferences 
between vB or vE users’ relatability with the data. However, it is 
positive that vE users mentioned personalisation aspects, such as 
relation to their country (F.E3, 4) and their height and age (F.E3), 
many months after one brief interaction. The challenge becomes 
how to sustain the enhanced relatability shown by vE users after 
the experience, continuing to translate complex global data into a 
relatable and understandable human-scale. 
5.3 Empowering Actionable Communication 
Acting to mitigate the consequences of climate change is more press-
ing than ever. However, previous HCI research seldom proposes 
action or solutions through climate change interaction projects 
[39, 40]. Our study has demonstrated the importance of a positive 
framing and an action-focused narrative. 
3040
Towards Relatable Climate Change Data DIS ’24, July 01–05, 2024, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark 
The interviews indicated that vE users perceived the informa-
tion as more valuable than vB users. The sense of usefulness and 
its connection to people’s daily lives largely came from the call 
for action proposed throughout the data-story, adapted to user’s 
current habits in vE. In the post-experience questionnaire, most vB 
users (n=6) reported no habit changes or reinforcement of existing 
behaviours, similar to half of vE users (n=5). However, a notable 
variation between the two versions was observed in the diversity 
of mentions of types of actions, with vB users mentioning three 
and vE users eight. This greater variability in actionable applica-
tions points to a deeper engagement and broader practice changes 
among vE users. These results align with the more profound sense 
of usefulness in vE seen in the interviews. 
Users mostly commented positively on the proposals for action 
but debated their usefulness and limits. We argue that this open de-
bate is important for productive climate dialogues and an important 
tension to consider in future applications. 
5.4 A Step Towards Posthumanistic Perspectives 
The SHCI community has called for diverse perspectives and cli-
mate change narratives, such as more-than-human cohabitation 
[95] and collective relations to nonhuman actors [44]. We have 
built on this research by exploring communication strategies that 
decenter the human in the narrative. Previous work has explored 
how human-defned concepts like time determines human-nature 
relations [95]. The challenge becomes questioning these human-
centric notions and opening up to alternative conceptions of time 
and space. Cohabitation demands from humans the understanding 
that they are not “apart” or “superior” to nature but instead are 
just one part of a diverse and complex system. Our experiment 
points to storytelling and decentering communication strategies 
working towards more inclusive perspectives and a sense of inclu-
sion in a broad, global ecosystem. The exploratory work done in 
urban gardens by [110] underscores the importance of improving 
human-nature relations through design by highlighting interdepen-
dencies. Our study builds on these experiments by evoking empathy 
and a sense of global responsibility that is an encouraging step to-
wards posthumanistic stances. We were particularly encouraged by 
users’ comments in the interviews about gaining a more holistic 
understanding of our global shared ecosystem. These insights were 
corroborated in the post-experience questionnaire, where the gen-
eralised comments related to ocean and whale information pointed 
to a raised consideration for the more-than-human, the entangle-
ments between humans and marine ecosystems, and human efects 
in natural environments. Klein argues that the changes needed to 
respond to the climate crisis are an opportunity to re-assess our 
relationships with each other and with nature [61]. This research 
not only linked climate data with users on an individual level, but 
it also connected them to a sense of global belonging that includes 
non-human actors. 
5.5 Refections on LLMs for More-than-human 
Representation 
The use of AI-powered models assisted in bringing the global scale 
of climate change to the individual sphere of each participant 
through personalised date and location information. Furthermore, we used the LLM to breathe life into the whale character by adapting 
the narration to "his" perspective and allowing a dialogue between 
this entity and the user. The AI Live Dialogue feature was meant 
to satisfy the curiosities of the users while improving engagement 
with the information and building empathy with the non-human 
story protagonist. 
A few users engaged with the LLM chat feature, pointing to 
a need for better integration with the story. However, most of 
them used the chat to delve deeper into the topics communicated 
– a promising result considering the main purpose of developing 
deeper interest and engagement with the data. Furthermore, the 
exploratory questions demonstrate the user’s curiosity about the 
tool and point to interesting avenues for exploration. Future experi-
ments should integrate such a feature more carefully into the story. 
Crafting engaging narrative hooks is essential to ensure user par-
ticipation, especially towards the end of the experience. Designing 
AI prompts that maintain the character’s story and personality is 
crucial. These conversations with the character, in crucial points 
throughout the story, could link more clearly to each data set and 
enhance engagement with the tool. 
AI-powered conversations between humans and more-than-
human characters can be explored to inspire empathy and posthu-
manistic perspectives. We acknowledge that using AI systems to 
give voice to more-than-human entities could be problematic as 
“AI technology itself imports a traditional, humanist form of logic” 
[109]. Building on the challenges posed by [58], we tried to work 
through the discomforts of designing in the intersections of hu-
man and non-human relations. The use of these systems demands 
a careful critical lens. Besides the dangers of possibly spreading 
misinformation [118], one needs to consider which perspectives 
are represented or what stereotypes might be inadvertently rein-
forced, depending on the information the LLM uses or is fed with. 
Also, one should question how these systems can help represent 
more-than-human entities since this information is human-made 
and inevitably carries a human perspective. This work is an ini-
tial experiment at using, in particular, storytelling and an attempt 
at decentering the human in the narrative to work through these 
tensions. We look forward to further delve into how these tools 
can be harnessed in this urgent context to enhance the sense of 
personifcation and empathy with a non-human character. 
5.6 Future Directions 
Besides the above suggestions related to LLMs, we point to other di-
rections for future exploration derived from the insights discussed. 
Considering the need for long-term engagement after the expe-
rience, strategies for deeper personalisation and more continuous 
connection are promising avenues to explore. For example, we see 
the great potential of AI for further personalised engagement. 
One aspect to note in our study is using a large touch-screen dis-
play to convey the data-story. This mode of interaction can impact 
the user’s engagement with the data. As discussed in 3.5, this output 
was used because it was already available in the lab and required 
no new purchases. Also, it was appropriate for a public display 
instead of having users engage with the story with a more common 
but less practical mouse and keyboard. Nevertheless, the nature 
of the communication strategies and interactive features allowed 
3041
DIS ’24, July 01–05, 2024, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark Ferreira, et al. 
for using these “more common” modes of interaction. Future work 
should test whether user engagement changed with other outputs 
and contexts. 
The success of the action-focused strategies to empower users, 
particularly in vE, but also their criticised limited range led us to 
envision future work that explores a broader set of proposed solu-
tions and uses deeper personalisation strategies to connect users 
with actions that are appropriate and stimulating to each person. 
Users tend to focus on what they already know and do, even when 
they mention that they learned something and will start to pay 
attention to it (e.g. S.B2, 10, 12). Interactive strategies focused on 
more personal data connections can assist in linking to less obvious 
and more impactful suggestions, for example, by allowing users 
to "zoom in" on what interests them and what they can help with, 
including within their particular communities. These experiences 
can assist people to “fnd joy in climate action” [57]. Furthermore, 
such features can help address the largely debated challenge of en-
gaging lay audiences with broader social change (besides individual 
behaviour) [11, 14, 76] also mentioned by [41]. The current study 
also faced the difculty of connecting users with actions outside 
their personal frame of infuence as they feel they have no agency in 
such matters. Future work should continue to explore strategies to 
narrow this gap, for example, by promoting civic engagement [30] 
through adapted suggestions that still feel relevant to an individual 
actor. The HCI and Design communities can further develop inter-
active systems with a strong social component [ 64] that connect to 
community and global challenges. This is no small feat, but only 
through experimentation and testing can we hope to contribute to 
this global challenge. 
6 CONCLUSION 
This research explores the crucial intersection of climate change 
communication and HCI, demonstrating how thoughtful commu-
nication strategies and intricate design elements infuence users’ 
engagement and perception of data-centric content for climate 
change. By contrasting two versions of an interactive narrative 
through a mixed-methods study, we shed light on the tangible 
benefts of introducing data humanism allied with storytelling, de-
centering the human in the narrative, and positive framing into HCI 
design — chiefy regarding its potential to enhance engagement, 
lead to posthumanistic perspectives, inspire productive dialogues 
and infuence action. 
The implications for the HCI community include flling a piv-
otal gap in the literature and emphasizing the importance of key 
communication strategies in creating engaging and relatable user 
experiences for communicating complex hyperobjects like climate 
change, particularly pointing to paths of making climate data more 
actionable and human-scaled. The presented communication and 
interaction pathways ofer new models of how climate change 
engagement can be explored and the role of digital technologies 
within these exchanges. We hope that our contribution potentiates 
ever greater, and more efcient, engagement with climate change 
topics through HCI. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
