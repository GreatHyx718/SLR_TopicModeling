Abstract 
Efforts to integrate living organisms in the design of new technolo-
gies are often motivated by prospects of greater sustainability and 
increased connection with more-than-human worlds. In this paper, 
we critically discuss these motivations by analysing the vast and 
mostly hidden ecologies of more-than-human organisms implicated 
in a biodesign lab experiment. Through the lenses of labour theory, 
we investigate the extent to which organisms’ bodily functions and 
relationships can be subsumed into capitalist modes of production. 
In order to help reveal and map out the network of more-than-
human contributors to biodesign, we develop a workshop method 
and a labour provenance analytical framework that identifies five 
types of more-than-human labourers, stretching from the centre 
to the periphery of biodesign. We conclude by discussing how sus-
tainable approaches should account for wider more-than-human 
ecologies, and how the labour lens could help stress conflicting

1 Introduction 
Bio-related research is becoming increasingly prominent within 
Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Design, motivated by 
the potential of living organisms to unlock novel applications 
across various domains [24, 35, 78, 89, 90], including fabrication 

CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chen et al. 
and material development [3, 10, 11, 34, 114, 116, 119, 122], gaming 
[59, 62, 96], electronics [65, 81, 85], living media/digital interactions 
[14, 18, 31, 41, 46, 97], etc. By leveraging organisms’ ability to adapt, 
regenerate and biodegrade, these applications are often consid-
ered more sustainable than those employing traditional materials 
and technologies [39, 112, 117]. By supporting designers and/or 
users’ attunement to specific living organisms, they are also seen 
as able to forge a greater connection to more-than-human worlds 
[8, 49, 50, 68, 86, 87, 120, 121]. 
In this paper, we critically reflect on these core motivations 
by analysing a biodesign experiment through the lenses of mul-
tispecies ecologies and labour theory. The experiment includes 
advanced forms of biodesign practices which not only integrate 
but also modify living organisms for particular purposes. These 
practices often draw on specialised tools and techniques borrowed 
from other fields such as molecular and synthetic biology, and are 
becoming increasingly accessible [4, 30] and popular within HCI 
(particularly through the proliferation of biolabs [63]). We decon-
struct the experiment, which uses synthetic biology methods to 
hybridise cells, first by describing each of its steps, and then by 
tracing the living origins of different components employed in each 
of these steps - through what we call a provenance mapping exer-
cise. This exercise reveals the large number of organisms that play 
a role in promoting the conditions necessary for transformation, 
sustenance, and reproduction of primary experimental subjects -
forms of life that were hidden behind laboratory reagents, barcodes, 
and serial numbers. This provenance analysis leads to the first main 
contribution of this paper: the expansion of considerations of biolab 
and biodesign practices, from a few organisms of interest to vast 
more-than-human ecologies. 
Following a critical trend within HCI that attempts to consider 
best practices to engage more-than-human organisms in research 
[17, 20, 40, 73, 87, 120], and particularly recent work that aims to 
analyse more-than-human participation through the lens of labour 
theory [17], we investigate the implications of interpreting par-
ticipation of organisms as metabolic, resistance and sustenance 
labour, discussing a trend for such labour to be increasingly sub-
sumed by capitalist practices, both within research and in resulting 
design applications. This critical position leads to the design of 
a workshop method that invites those who routinely work with 
interventional forms of biodesign research to a) situate organisms 
within an ecology of species, b) reflect on the labour of organisms 
through assigning job titles, and c) consider ways to improve their 
welfare. 
The labour analysis and workshop culminate in the second main 
contribution of this paper: a novel analytical framework that we 
call labour provenance and which aims to help researchers trace 
the living labour behind various components and reveal how struc-
tural positions within design practices can condition the visibility 
of organisms’ contribution and the levels of subsumption they 
can be subjected to. The framework identifies five types of more-
than-human labourers: 1) primary biological labourers, or the main 
organisms considered in the design; 2) specific skills labourers, those 
that provide new features or complement the primary organisms 
3) tool-based labourers, organisms that contribute to the control of 
primary and skills labourers, 4) support and sustenance labourers, 
who contribute to nurture different organisms, and 5) evaluation and feedback labourers, organisms employed to give feedback on 
the experiment outcomes. 
We conclude by discussing the contribution of the work to a) 
drawing attention to extended more-than-human ecologies in biode-
sign, b) expanding notions of sustainability, and c) providing a plat-
form to discuss ethical practices in biological HCI. By using labour 
provenance as a lens, we can expand more-than-human perspec-
tives and prompt a re-evaluation of what it means to engage with 
life in design and HCI. 
2 Reframing the living in HCI 
HCI and Design researchers have developed new frameworks for 
integrating living organisms in digital technologies through con-
cepts such as “Biological HCI” [ 90], “Living Bits” [ 91], “Living Me-
dia Interfaces” [78], “Living Artefacts” [55], “Microbe-HCI” [60], 
etc. Emergent frameworks have further attempted to synthesise 
taxonomies to “surface the livingness of Microbial Displays” [61], 
or explore bio-digital “habitabilities” [118] and case studies have 
explored the integration of specific organisms’ unique attributes 
into novel interfaces, such as dinoflagellate’s bioluminescence [85], 
flavo- [ 37] and cyanobacteria’s [121] vivid colours, mycelium’s abil-
ity to grow into resilient shapes [34, 116], Bacillus subtilis (natto) 
cells’ responsiveness to moisture [117], or the increasing accessi-
bility of yeast’s DNA manipulation [42]. Often, explorations are 
underpinned by an assumption that products that are based on liv-
ing matter might be more sustainable, typically due to organisms’ 
ability to grow, adapt and/or decompose [39]. 
In parallel to this trend to integrate living organisms in new 
products and interfaces, we have also seen an expansion of method-
ological and critical approaches. Such approaches aim to pluralise 
perspectives and include the voices of more-than-human species, 
(re)shaping the ways in which HCI engages with the natural world 
and responds to increasingly pressing ecological issues. Such ap-
proaches include participatory methods for more-than-human [2, 
19, 67] as well as multispecies interaction and cohabitation [49, 57, 
73, 106], recognition of more-than-human labour [58] and "non-
participation" [17], among others. There have also been a breadth 
of examples that look at the more-than-human as a way to criti-
cally expand notions of time [8, 8, 48, 86, 94], materiality [50, 120], 
care [68, 84, 87], and reframe communal [10, 20, 40] and individ-
ual [9, 83, 120] experiences around the living. These approaches 
attempt to challenge human-centric attitudes, intersecting with 
emergent notions of feminist care and posthumanist HCI [58, 107], 
feminist care ethics [58, 108], unmaking [7, 69, 99, 109], temporal 
design [93], sustainability [77, 101], and ethics [32, 44, 79] in HCI. 
In this paper, we are particularly interested in the characterisa-
tion of labour outside of human experience [17, 58] and in using 
labour as a lens to legitimise the contribution of more-than-human 
organisms in design practice [17]. We attempt to apply the con-
cept of labour to our analysis of ecological provenance in order to 
sensitise researchers towards the unique ways in which different or-
ganisms contribute their skills and bodies to design practice. While 
some more-than-human species can be seen to perform labour sim-
ilar to that of humans — such as horses transporting goods, dogs 
guarding herds and whales being trained as military spies — many 
others, as we will discuss in this paper, require a rethinking of what 
Labour Provenance as a Lens to Reveal More-Than-Human Ecologies in Biological Design and HCI CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
constitutes labour and what could translate into imbalances and 
modes of domination. This rethinking, as we will address later in 
the discussion, can in turn invite reflection on the broader spec-
trum of more-than-human labour beyond the living, suggesting 
directions for future work. 
In the following sections, we report on our biodesign case study, 
the mapping of its labour ecologies, and review literature on more-
than-human labour to later analyse the different manifestations 
and define different types of more-than-human labourers. 
3 Biodesign case study: constructing the hybrid 
Our case study centres on a hybridisation experiment, conducted as 
a sequel to another arts-science project, Crossing Kingdoms [110], 
now with a renewed aim to question "organism-agnostic" [15] ap-
proaches in biotechnology. As discussed by Calvert & Szymanski 
[15], in lab practices, microorganisms such as yeast and Escherichia 
coli (E. coli) are often treated as vessels for standardised interchange-
able genetic parts, or "BioBricks" [102] akin to Lego bricks.Such 
approaches are echoed within HCI research, where these organ-
isms are often referred to as “living biological computers" [91], 
"bio-digital interfaces" [31], “living interfaces” [80], and "bio-hybrid 
devices" [82]. Our experiment aimed to critique these approaches 
using common synthetic biology techniques to ’hybridise’1 yeast 
with human cells. The idea was that the combination of cells with 
very different moral statuses would complicate and unsettle the 
organism-agnostic framework. 
The experiment involved us engaging with lab practices, and 
delving into various specialised knowledge and the community of 
researchers around it. Supported by a collaborative grant, we con-
ducted the experiment in our university’s synthetic biology lab. The 
background of the first and third authors brought to the experiment 
a new perspective, allowing a critical and reflexive engagement 
with routine lab practices. Being aware that many lab components 
originated from living organisms, we started a provenance analysis 
to trace the impact of our actions on the more-than-human world. 
Initially focused on cell lines and genetic components, our scope 
expanded through closer review of lab records and reflective discus-
sions. This led us to critically analyse the extent to which a variety 
of organisms had and were contributing, that is, labouring, for our 
experiment to take place. By retracing this experiment through 
the lens of labour, we were able to illuminate the extensive net-
work of human and more-than-human contributions underpinning 
well-established lab protocols. We see this as a natural extension 
of the critique prompted by the project. In what follows, we detail 
the six main experiment steps and contextualise them within our 
provenance framework. 
Step I Sourcing primary organisms and planning: (Fig 2) For 
the experiment, we used “standardised cell lines”, which 
are commercially available cells commonly used in labs 
and sourced from providers like atcc.org and neb.com. 
The main cells used were: Human Embryonic Kidney 293 
(HEK) cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae BJ5465 (Brewer’s 
yeast). In this standardisation process, human cells were

two organisms instead of the strictly biological definition of fusing two organisms into 
one single organism.

and planning genetic modifications. 
“immortalised” [56] once they were removed from the 
source and replicated in the lab for commercialisation. 
The hybridisation involved adding “molecular hands” — 
binding molecules — to the surfaces of both cell types to 
facilitate their connection. We did so by introducing genes 
encoding the binding molecules into the cells using small 
DNA carriers called plasmids. We used genetic editing 
"tools" like restriction enzymes (to cut DNA), polymerases 
(to copy DNA), and ligases (to join DNA pieces). The hy-
bridisation experiment took about five months of trial 
and error, which we elaborate in the following sections, 
focusing on the part involving yeast. 
Step II Identifying genes of interest and selection mecha-
nisms: (Fig 3 and 4) We used modified HEK cells whose 
surfaces are covered with "Green Fluorescent Protein" 
(GFP), provided by our lab colleagues. For yeast cells, we 
introduced genes to surface anti-GFP nanobodies (which 
would bind with the GFP of modified HEK cells) and a red 
internal fluorescent protein, mCherry (to make the yeast 
glow red, aiding microscopic observation of their interac-
tions). Together with our lab colleagues, we added each of 
them to a different plasmid for cell transformation. To en-
sure that only successfully modified cells survived, we de-
vised a two-step “selection mechanism”: for the mCherry 
plasmid, we planned to add genes that protect yeasts from 
an antibiotic in the medium; for the anti-GFP plasmid, 
we planned to add a gene that allows cells to produce an 
essential amino acid that was missing from the medium, 
so that only modified cells could survive. 
Step III Constructing plasmids with genes of interest: (Fig 4 
and 5) 
With the help of lab colleagues who designed the plas-
mids and guided construction, both plasmids were created 
by combining the different DNA parts, including the de-
sired genes, the antibiotic resistant genes, essential amino 
acid producing gene, and basic components for a plasmid: 
the backbone (the plasmid’s basic structure), promoters 
(which drive gene activity), terminators (which mark the 
end of a gene), and markers (to help track genes). 
Step IV Multiplying plasmids with E. coli : (Fig 6 and 7)

light (left), and under fluorescent light (right), red cells on

(left) and a map showing one of the plasmids, designed by lab 
colleagues, with assemblage of different DNA components 
(right) 
The plasmids were then introduced into E. coli for mul-
tiplication. The bacteria were defrosted, heat shocked to 
uptake the plasmid, and then placed in the medium with 
antibiotics, which ensured that only successfully trans-
formed bacteria would grow. Colony appearance, which 
indicated initial success, was then confirmed with two 
tests. First, colony PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) am-
plified the DNA to check if the plasmid was present (a 
method also used in COVID testing). Second, we used gel 
electrophoresis to separate DNA by size, comparing it to 
a “DNA ladder” (a ruler to measure DNA) to confirm the 
presence of the target DNA. 
Step V Transforming yeast cells with the constructed plas-
mids: (Fig 8 and 9)

plasmids from E. coli 
Figure 7: Step IV - Photo of failed transformation of bacterial 
culture (left), and photo of gel electrophoresis (right) 
Figure 8: Step V - Diagram of transforming yeast with the 
constructed plasmids 
After extracting plasmids from E. coli through a process 
called Miniprep, we transferred them into yeast cells. This 
involved growing the yeast, mixing it with the plasmids, 
and then placing the cells again in a medium with antibi-
otics - now antibiotic G418 which allowed only modified 
yeast to grow. We used colony PCR and gel electrophore-
sis to confirm that yeast cells took up the desired genes, 
including anti-GFP nanobody and mCherry. 
Step VI Co-culturing the transformed yeast and HEK cells 
(Fig 10 and 11) 
Finally, we grew the modified yeast and human (HEK) 
cells together in a special culture medium that helped 
HEK cells, which are more delicate, to survive. HEK cells 
attached to the culture plate, acting as a surface for yeast 
to “hybridise” with. After a few hours, we washed away 
any loose cells, leaving only the hybridised cells. . . voilà!

We see this experiment as a rich site of investigation. Its lab 
practices connect to other works in the fields of biodesign, bio-HCI 
and bioart, which increasingly employ a range of synthetic and 
microbiology techniques. Common protocols include gene editing, 
plasmid construction [42], PCR [64], tissue culture [123], bacterial 
culture and media preparation [8, 63], which, as we will discuss, 
often obscure underlying more-than-human ecologies. 
4 Biodesign case study as a more-than-human 
ecology 
Closer analysis reveals that experiments like this one rely not only 
on the primary organisms – here, human and yeast – but also 
on a complex more-than-human ecosystem. From the microbes that provided genetic editing tools to the plants and animals that 
contributed to the production of reagents and media, a myriad of 
often overlooked organisms played crucial roles in sustaining these 
practices. In this section, we revisit the experiment step-by-step, 
illustrating and commenting on what we call a provenance analysis, 
which traces the contribution of organisms involved in different 
components. Where possible, we reduce repetition, noting that 
some organisms supported multiple steps (e.g. recurring agents and 
reagents). 
Step I Sourcing primary organisms and planning: (Fig 12) 
As mentioned above, primary organisms originated from 
yeast and Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) Cells, as illus-
trated in figure 12. 
Step II Identifying genes of interest and selection mecha-
nisms (Fig 13): Genes of interest can come from various 
species, including animals, plants, and microbes, which are 
chosen based on desired functions. For instance, camelids 
are valuable sources of nanobody genes for immunologi-
cal purposes [33], while organisms like jellyfish and sea 
anemones provide fluorescent genes commonly used as 
reporters [22]. 
For selection mechanisms, many antibiotic and resistance 
genes have evolved as natural defence and competition 
tools in microorganisms. In the lab, these microbial traits 
are repurposed to ensure that only host cells incorporating 
the desired genes can survive under selective conditions. 
Step III Constructing plasmids with genes of interest (Fig 
14): Many genetic components in the plasmid and edit-
ing tools were sourced originally from various organisms. 
However, many are now mass-produced through "recom-
binant" methods, where genetic sequences are extracted 
from their natural source and replicated using host or-
ganisms, typically E. coli. Additives such as glycerol and 
bovine serum albumin (BSA) for genetic editing tools may 
nevertheless primarily come from living sources. 
Step IV Multiplying plasmids with E. coli (Fig 15): The bac-
terial transformation process involves three main proce-
dures that rely on living organisms: 1) Bacterial culture: 
organisms that provide components supporting bacterial 
growth, including storage agent glycerol, nutrients and 
antibiotics in culture media; 2) Colony PCR: organisms 
that provide tools that identify and amplify specific genes, 
i.e. primers and polymerase; and 3) Gel electrophoresis: 
organisms that provide ingredients for the gel matrix and 
DNA ladder. 
Step V Transforming yeast cells with the constructed plas-
mids (Fig 16): In this step, we identified organisms impli-
cated in: 1) Miniprep gene extraction: organisms behind 
enzymes used to break bacterial cell walls and purify DNA; 
2) Cell culture: organisms behind yeast storage and culture 
media; 3) Yeast transformation: additives in the transfor-
mation reaction mix. 
Step VI Co-culturing the transformed yeast and HEK cells 
(Fig 17): In this stage, organisms are mainly involved in 
tissue culture media and cell maintenance. Yeast extract, 
peptone, and agar represent common organism-derived 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chen et al. 
Figure 12: Step I - Illustration showing primary organisms (Human (HEK) cells and yeast cells) as well as their origin stories 
nutrients in bacterial and yeast culture media. Tissue cul-
ture media, however, implicate a much wider range of or-
ganisms, including those that contribute to foetal bovine 
serum (FBS), amino acids, vitamins, and glucose. These 
components are essential for providing the nutrients, en-
ergy, and environmental conditions that mammalian cells 
need to grow and function in vitro. 
The involvement of these organisms in our experiment could 
be interpreted through several lenses. Here we chose the lens of 
labour theory as it allows us to question typical organism-agnostic 
approaches that initially motivated the project. The following sec-
tion reviews recent literature on more-than-human labour, which 
informed our analysis. 
5 Conceptualising more-than-human labour 
5.1 Levels of control: from formal to real 
subsumption of more-than-human labour 
Classic literature on labour identifies two forms of subsumption 
to capitalist production. Formal subsumption involves co-opting 
existing activities into capitalist production, which usually means 
turning producers into wage workers without fundamentally alter-
ing the productive activities. Real subsumption is a more advanced 
stage that transforms the labour process and production methods 
to maximise value [75]. 
In Animals and Capitals [115], Dinesh Wadiwel extends such 
notions to animal labour. Formal subsumption can be seen in tradi-
tional animal husbandry, where pre-capitalist practices, like using 
animals for transport and milk, are integrated into capitalist sys-
tems to generate surplus value. Real subsumption is evident in 
industrial farming, where animals’ entire life cycles are restruc-
tured to maximise efficiency and profit. Wadiwel describes real 
subsumption in the fish industry as "the whole life and death of these animals is brought into alignment with the rhythms of production, in 
such a way as the lives of these animals look nothing like the lives 
of fishes in ‘nature’." He continues to say: “the history of animal 
agriculture moves this formal subsumption towards a ‘real subsump-
tion’, in so far as animals become inseparable from the productive 
processes within which humans place them, such that the morphology 
and livelihoods of animals become intertwined and interdependent 
on human utilisation. ” 
These concepts can be extended to other biological kingdoms 
and the realms of biodesign and biotechnology, where the subsump-
tion of more-than-human labour is manifested in the utilisation 
of organisms’ biological processes, or the extraction of substances 
from these processes. Formal subsumption occurs when existing bio-
logical processes – like microbes breaking down pollutants, worms 
oxygenating the land – are incorporated without altering the organ-
isms. Real subsumption arises when selective breeding or molecular 
biology techniques are employed for optimisation, whereby the 
lives of these organisms – be they animals, plants, or microbes – 
are fundamentally shaped by imperatives of value creation. In this 
case, the microbes introduced to break down pollutants would then 
be engineered and/or mass produced to enhance efficiency. 
Biotechnology exemplifies real subsumption vividly. As research 
evolves, organisms are literally designed for experimental and in-
dustrial use, with genomes streamlined to facilitate complex exper-
iments or produce valuable compounds. Since it is accepted that 
genetically altered organisms can pose threats to natural ecosys-
tems, they are typically subjected to strict containment measures 
at physical, chemical, or genetic levels [111]. This containment 
ensures zero survival outside of their designated role in knowledge 
production, expressing a totalising form of real subsumption. An 
example of this approach is Escherichia coli (E. coli), which is often 
referred to as the quintessential ‘machinery’ [66] for turning natu-
rally occurring substances from a diverse array of organisms into

Figure 13: Step II - Illustration and origin stories of identified organisms contributing to genes of interest, selection mechanisms 
and visual markers 
highly controllable, large-scale microbial productions. The ability 
to harness E. coli in this way represents a clear example of real 
subsumption, where the natural capabilities of the organism are 
not merely utilised but fundamentally reshaped and optimised for 
production. 
Overall, common experimental techniques and components in 
biotechnology reveal a tendency for the field to move from formal 
subsumption towards real subsumption. When tracing the histo-
ries, origins and production methods of common substances used in 
laboratories, one often finds a progression from natural sources to 
genetically modified alternatives [29] - a progression that is tied to 
the integration of these processes into capitalist logics, and poten-
tially other drivers such as product safety. Often, a living organism 
might serve as the natural source for a particular substance, in an 
example of formal subsumption. As demand for research on this 
particular organism increases, or a drive to integrate its outputs into consumer products is manifested, there is a move towards stream-
lined production methods, typically involving genetically modified 
organisms. Through this process, their living functions become 
more controlled, leading to more “real” forms of subsumption. 
The consideration of the ways in which biodesign practices can 
be situated within a system of production can help us deepen and 
extend reflections on the relationships between human and more-
than-human organisms in biological HCI. Through the concept of 
more-than-human labour subsumption, we can start to consider 
not only how organisms are handled during the design process, 
but also how the scaling of research practices and translation into 
commercial products beyond academia may affect the more-than-
human.

5.2 Forms of labour: metabolic, resistance, 
sustenance 
While the notion of subsumption can help us evaluate levels of 
control over and intervention on organisms, it is also useful to 
consider the kinds of labour that more-than-human organisms can 
perform in design and HCI research. Below, we draw on existing 
literature to discuss three types of living processes that commonly 
underpin more-than-human contributions to design practices, in 
the section after this, we will map the identified organism labourers 
into the three categories. 
Metabolic labour focuses on the bodily and biological processes 
of organisms – energy expenditure, self-regeneration, reproduc-
tion, and other metabolic activities that are directed towards value 
creation. Scholars like Beldo [6], Coulter [21] and Wadiwel [115] 
describe this through concepts like "microbiological labour", "bod-
ily work" and "reproductive labour", extending traditional ideas 
of labour to include organisms as legitimate subjects of labour. 
In the context of biodesign, metabolic labour represents the most 
prevalent forms of organismal work. 
Furthermore, scholars have identified organisms’ contribution to 
value production in sites of encounters [5, 43] and even resistance [115]. Wadiwel specifically points out the potential of animal resis-
tance to be co-opted into further capitalist value generation, with 
such resistance often driving technological innovation. Such forms 
of ‘non-compliant’ contribution can also be seen in laboratory mi-
croorganisms, with its resistance (e.g. to antibiotics) being fully 
operationalised as genetic editing tools. Resistance labour offers a 
lens for examining contributions that are a by-product of organisms 
non-compliance, recognising the possibility of shaping technology 
to appropriate all forms of living processes. 
Drawing on social reproduction theory [12], ’sustenance labour’ 
looks at how the support and sustenance of organism can be pro-
vided by other organisms or environmental factors. This "backstage" 
labour is essential for the continuation of metabolic and resistance 
labour, as it underpins the conditions for these contributions to 
persist over time. Here, we see a shift in focus towards the social 
and ecological dependencies necessary for the ongoing productivity 
of organisms, extending the framework of care and environmental 
support to more-than-human contexts. 
These forms of labour broaden our understanding of what counts 
as labour and productivity, providing a more inclusive lens to assess 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chen et al. 
organismal contribution while acknowledging their interconnected-
ness. Metabolic labour involves direct value generation, resistance 
labour captures value created through conflict or non-compliance, 
and sustenance labour focuses on the supportive roles of other 
organisms in these processes. In some projects, these roles can 
overlap, e.g. with a metabolic function manifested as resistance. 
Additionally, the above-mentioned labour forms can be carried 
out in varying capacities. Here we distinguish between constant 
producers (e.g. microbes used in recombinant production) and one-
off contributors (e.g. jellyfish that provide GFP gene sequence, or 
soil microbes that provide resistance gene sequences). Constant 
producers continuously generate value through ongoing ‘living 
labour’, while one-off contributors offer a singular input that be-
comes standardised and synthetically produced in labs. 
5.3 Living labour vs automation/synthetic 
production 
Nowadays, some components that originated from organisms as 
one-off producers can be recombinantly produced, and some could 
be replaced by alternatives that do not even come from living or-
ganisms. However, the majority of components utilised in biotech 
research and production still remain largely sourced from living 
organisms. This is due to cost-effectiveness, as it is still hard to 
synthesise the complexity of their living processes, let alone scaling 
them up. For example, while certain components and genetic edit-
ing tools, such as glycerin and primers, can be synthesised more 
easily, processes like DNA replication can be performed using ma-
chines (instead of using in-cell replication, such as through E. coli) 
at very small scales. The use of synthetic methods and machineries 
in biotechnology, and in vitro DNA manipulation [70] that enables 
researchers to perform controlled, small-scale DNA synthesis and 
assembly outside of living organisms is still in very early stages. 
Synthetic/automation techniques are still seen as falling short in 
terms of replicating the complexities and scale of living systems. In 
other words, microbes like E. coli and yeast provide environment 
for DNA replication and protein production at a scale and speed 
that are difficult to reproduce synthetically, due to their in vivo 
cellular mechanisms. Similarly, sustenance components such as 
yeast extract and FBS are combinations of complex growth factors 
and nutrients, which pose significant challenges for developing 
synthetic alternatives. 
Therefore, while there are alternatives, more-than-human labour 
still remains at the core of laboratorial practices. Even high-end 
platforms such as genome foundries [ 113] rely on living organisms 
for components and gene replication. Additionally, synthetic and 
automated methods themselves carry unique labour ecologies that 
could be the subject of further scrutiny. 
5.4 Biodesign case study: mapping more-than-human labour 
The list presented in Table 1 reflects our best attempt at offering 
a non-exhaustive glimpse into the intricate and expansive labour 
ecologies underpinning our design experiment. However, we ac-
knowledge that even more organisms could have been implicated in 
the design process. Indeed, each investigation into lab components 
or exploration of ready-made materials (such as reaction mixes, genetic snippets, or components manufactured through diverse 
methods) unveiled new organismal sources. 
6 Labour provenance workshop 
Considering the value of identifying the many forms of life and 
their contributions to research, we designed a workshop that aimed 
to help participants expand ecologies of laboratory settings and 
recognise hidden forms of more-than-human labour. The workshop 
was comprised of three stages (Fig. 18): 
(1) Organisms Identification: Participants map the organisms 
involved in a chosen experiment. To broaden their perspec-
tive, we provide prompts informed by our provenance and 
labour analysis, featuring reagents and tools not typically 
associated with living organisms, such as primers, restriction 
enzymes, carrier DNA, etc. This exercise aims to reveal the 
ecologies of often-overlooked organismal contributors in 
laboratorial work. 
(2) Labour Recognition: Participants are then tasked with de-
scribing each identified organism’s role in the experiment 
and assigning them a job title that acknowledges their contri-
bution. This step encourages participants to reconceptualise 
organismal involvement as a form of labour. 
(3) Welfare Reflection: In the final exercise, participants con-
sider the ’employment journey’ of the listed organisms. They 
are prompted to identify points where the welfare of these 
organisms could be improved, fostering ethical reflections 
from the more-than-human perspective. 
We tested the workshop with 4 groups of 4-5 postgraduate MSc 
students from the School of Biological Sciences who carried out 
biolab experiments as part of their day-to-day activities. We were 
particularly interested in testing the method with participants who 
are habituated to traditional laboratory practices within biotechnol-
ogy. Participants completed the three activities in about 30 minutes. 
Overall, the exercises proved to be generative and thought-
provoking. Participants were generally surprised by the number 
of organisms involved in their experiments and some expressed 
having started to think about usage of lab and genetic tools dif-
ferently. When prompted to think about how organisms can be 
better treated in their experiments, they revealed a spectrum of 
inclinations to ethical reflections on more-than-human labour. 
6.1 More-than-human labourer identification 
Guided by the prompts, each group identified a range of organ-
isms directly or indirectly contributing to their experiments. Most 
groups started with organisms that were the experimental subjects, 
provided main genes of interest, or common genetic "parts". 
"So firstly we have different genes that come from Drosophila, 
which is the insect providing us olfactory receptors and 
also the jellyfish providing the sfGFP [a fluorescent pro-
tein]. " (Group 1) 
“So, basically, we infected mice with breast cancer cells, 
which is a nice way of saying that we injected them and 
gave them breast cancer. ” (Group 2) 
“We use GFP protein as a reporter. So the GFP protein is 
from the jellyfish” (Group 3)

Figure 18: The labour mapping workshop template 
“We have the packaging, which is from the jellyfish.” 
(Group 4) 
As the exercise progressed, groups expanded their focus to indi-
rectly involved organisms, such as microbes that provided resistant 
genes or restriction enzymes used in their experiments. 
"We also have ampicillin genes coming from bacteria, 
we give them [as a job title] the ’plasmid makers’. " 
(Group 1) 
“And then we use the Taq polymerase to, like, dupli-
cate our DNA. [...] It’s from Thermus Aquaticus [a 
bacterium]. And we call it the production engineer.” 
(Group 3) 
“And then we have the resistance genes which come 
from Streptomyces Griseus and we call them the head 
of security. ” (Group 4) 
Some participants were surprised by the multitude of organisms 
involved in their experiments. Others expressed a sense of gratitude 
to the organisms. 
“I think I just realised how many organisms actually 
go into this. Because I don’t think about it when I’m in 
the lab doing an experiment, especially the restriction 
enzyme. You don’t really think about it as something 
that’s given to you by an organism. You just assume 
that, yeah, you actually do the research right now about 
where do those enzymes come from and where do the 
media, does it consist of any animal related or plant 
related or bacteria related things? So I think it’s a re-
ally good shout for me to think about these things.” 
(Group 1) 
“So first and foremost, our big MVP [Most Valuable 
Player] with this was the mice that actually received 
cancer, which we’ve affectionately given the name Can-
cer Bearers. [...] I think they need a medal for that.” 
(Group 2) 
Interestingly, with the labour identification in mind, Group 2 
was able to differentiate two roles for the same organism. They not 
only identified the directly contributing mice, who received cancer cells, but also the mice behind the stage who produced the cancer 
cell lines. 
“There were also the mice that we didn’t get to see their 
faces, but they were the ones that the cell lines were 
derived from, these breast cancer cell lines that we were 
then infecting the other mice [...] So we’ve chosen to 
kind of make that separation between the two roles, 
even though it’s the same organism. ” (Group 2) 
6.2 Describing more-than-human job titles 
Under the context of this labour mapping exercise, participants 
were guided to recognise the contribution made by more-than-
human organisms in their experiment and view that as labour. 
Such acknowledgement is strengthened by giving job titles to the 
identified more-than-human labourers. 
Group 1 used descriptive roles for job titles, mainly acknowledg-
ing organisms as providers of vital components for the experiment: 
“And we also have the E. coli to multiply the reporter 
plasmid. So it’s generally a ’plasmid replicator’ for 
us. And also we have the reporter mammalian HeLa 
cells which report the production of the protein length. ” 
(Group 1) 
Other groups applied a range of analogies for the job descriptions. 
Group 2 described the mechanical aspect of the labour, such as 
referring to the bacteria that provided CRISPR, a technique for 
DNA modification, as the ‘scissor manufacturers’ and the virus 
responsible for CRISPR delivery as the ‘delivery guy’: 
“Then we have ah, the bacteria that CRISPR actually 
originated from that we’ve adopted that tool from which 
we’ve called the Scissor Manufacturers. [...] We have the 
way that we actually were able to use CRISPR to knock 
down the gene in the cells was by delivering them to the 
cells with a virus. [...] We’ve chosen to put it with the 
job title of facilitator slash delivery guy because they’re 
really facilitating this introduction of CRISPR. They’re 
delivering it to the cells. ” (Group 2) 
Group 3 and 4 came up with more value-based roles. Group 3 re-
ferred, for example, to the bacterium Thermus Aquaticus, who helps 
duplicate DNA, as the ‘production engineer’ and the bacterium 
Bacillus stearothermophilus, who provides restriction enzymes to 
select and combine DNA fragments, as the ‘HR’. Notably, the group 
even started to critically represent human organisations in this 
‘multispecies work context’, addressing humans as ‘the CEO’ or ‘evil 
overlord’. 
“We used E. coli to contain that library. So we would call 
it like the ’warehouse manager’. So the GFP protein is 
from the jellyfish, we’ll call it like the ’visual specialist’ 
because it’s provided us [with] the reporter gene and 
then we use the Taq polymerase to like duplicate our 
DNA. [...] It’s called Thermus aquaticus and we call 
it the ’production engineer’. [...] And so because it’s 
their job to duplicate the DNA and then for the DNA 
assemblies, we used BsaI, which comes from Bacillus 
stearothermophilus. And the title we gave them was 
HR, because it selects the DNA and combines them [...] 
Labour Provenance as a Lens to Reveal More-Than-Human Ecologies in Biological Design and HCI CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
at this point I would say maybe the human is the CEO, 
maybe the ’evil overlord’. ” (Group 3) 
Group 4 created roles that described more abstract functions 
provided by the organisms. The group interpreted the ability to 
signal a successful transformation as “quality assurance manager” 
and acknowledged microbes’ ability to know what it is to be built 
through the title of “construction specialist”: 
“We have the packaging, which is from the jellyfish. I 
do remember the name. So we titled it as the quality 
assurance manager because my thinking is that the 
reporter used acts as a visual aid. Right. Essentially. And 
if there’s something good and that’s quality. So that’s 
something. Yeah. And then we have the backbone, which 
is the T7 bacteriophage and we call the construction 
specialist as it is the building block, is the one that 
is built for the whole construction. And then we have 
the resistance genes which come from Streptomyces 
griseus and we call them as head of security, [...] Yeah, 
it provides a resistance. ” (Group 4) 
6.3 ‘Be a better boss for more-than-human 
workers’ 
The last exercise of the workshop asked participants to reflect 
on the ‘employment journey’ of the more-than-human labourers 
and consider opportunities for better treatment. The responses 
varied from exploring concepts such as consent and coercion from 
microbial perspectives, to a relativisation of organisms’ welfare. 
Group 1 analysed forms of “exploitation” from the perspective 
of microbial workers, pointing out their metabolic burden and 
sacrifices in the making of valuable substances for humans. 
“None of these were equal. The bacteria doesn’t actually 
need plasmid to survive. It’s something that it did be-
cause we made it to do so. That’s one way of exploiting 
an organism where you’re forcing it to produce some-
thing that’s not relevant to its metabolism. And finally, 
at the end of the experiment, she had to kill all of her 
cells (to extract the plasmids they produce). ” (Group 1) 
Group 2 responded to the task with differentiation based on the 
species, with more appreciation towards mammalians. 
“Obviously there’s a lot of exploitation involved with 
these in vivo projects. [...] it becomes a much greater 
deal when you’re, you know, you’re working with [mam-
mals]. ” (Group 2) 
Regarding what can be done differently, the group identified limita-
tions in current scientific structures. 
“You can provide them with good food and hopefully 
like as little stress as possible within their short, three 
week to month long lives. But like I said, there’s only 
so much you can do. At the end of the day, scientific 
progress requires that these, quote, lesser animals get 
exploited. And I use less with some reservation but it 
requires them to be exploited. And like I said, just doing 
stuff like this makes you really appreciate the fact that 
they are in that situation. ” (Group 2) Group 3 expressed concern about the required task, thinking that 
considering microbial welfare would defy the progressiveness of 
transitioning from using components sourced continuously from 
several organisms to employing microbes to manufacturing them 
through recombination. 
“If you know that production of insulin, we needed to 
use so many creatures and to extract (from them) and 
then now we shifted to the E. coli recombinant engineer-
ing. So I think this is a step ahead to move away from 
exploiting. So I think we shouldn’t be thinking about 
exploiting these bacteria for experiments. ” (Group 3) 
Group 4 found the task challenging, as they were not sure how 
organisms without complex neural systems could be mishandled. 
“I don’t know how you could potentially exploit bacteria. 
I guess you couldn’t misuse it. Yeah. And you could 
release it through the environment or something. I don’t 
know how specifically you would exploit them because 
I don’t think they feel pain. ” (Group 4) 
The workshop demonstrated that labour provenance can serve as 
a valuable tool to discuss the ecologies of organisms implicated 
in biodesign experiments. Overall, participants went through a 
process of identifying labouring organisms at the centre of their 
experiments and slowly stretched out to more peripheral organisms, 
carrying out a deeper analysis of common lab tools. This process 
underscores how the visibility of organisms’ contribution is often 
conditioned by their structural roles within a design workflow. 
During the exercise of labour recognition and job title assignment, 
some of the participant responses showed an emerging awareness 
of such structural nuances. Examples can be seen in the response 
that recognises the organism-concealing effect of common tools, 
such as restriction enzymes, and the response that acknowledges 
and differentiates the labour of mice in the back and front stage 
of their experiments, recognising that they went through similar 
metabolic processes. The last exercise revealed multiple ways of 
looking at organisms’ welfare and that some forms of life are indeed 
deemed as belonging to different categories of value depending on 
one’s definition of ethical boundaries. From this, we found it useful 
to define a framework that delineates these structural nuances. 
7 An analytical framework of 
more-than-human labourers in biodesign 
Building on the case study, workshop findings, and the potential 
for labour analysis to generate reflection, we propose a framework 
that describes five types of labourers. This framework is intended 
to help designers analyse the structural roles of more-than-human 
labourers, from the centre to the periphery of biodesign practices. 
While the forms of labour (metabolic, resistance, sustenance) ad-
dress the capabilities of the organisms, the proposed framework 
conceptualises their job positions, focusing on how these capabilities 
are harnessed for value creation. By situating organisms within 
specific positions and functions in design processes, the framework 
provides a means to 1) foreground all implicated labourers includ-
ing peripheral ones, 2) clarify division of labour and interconnected 
relations, and 3) identify levels of control and intervention exerted 
on organisms by discussing their levels of subsumption. Below, we 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chen et al. 
elaborate on these types, their different characteristics, and the 
corresponding modes of subsumption discussed above. We use ex-
amples from biological HCI to expand its applicability within the 
CHI community. 
(1) Primary biological labourers Primary biological labour-
ers perform the core function of a given project, they are 
the main experimental subjects or host organisms. Their 
labour is fully embodied and often highly standardised, such 
as the yeast and human cell lines in the case study. Within 
wider biodesign/HCI practices, examples include mycelium 
utilised in biomaterial fabrication [34], silkworms used in 
biofabrication projects [53, 88], bacteria for film plates [117], 
etc. Uprooted from their natural environments, organisms 
can undergo real subsumption, where every aspect of their 
living process is optimised and directed towards production, 
making them highly dependent on specialist human inter-
vention and unlikely to survive outside of these productive 
activities. In many instances, their resistance is turned into 
an essential driver of productivity. Primary labourers are 
the most visible labourers. When belonging to the animal 
kingdom, and indeed when they are mammals, their contri-
butions can be acknowledged by ethical lab protocols (e.g. 
[98, 105]) and animal rights movements [38]. 
(2) Specific skills labourers Specific skills labourers provide 
specialised biological functions, raw materials or traits with-
out directly performing the main task. These organisms or 
their components are often harvested for specific purposes, 
such as bacteria and jellyfish that supplied functional DNA 
sequences for plasmid construction in our case study. Exam-
ples in the wider biodesign/HCI practices include bacteria 
that offer bioluminescence for digital silkscreen printing 
[100], and the microbes, fungi or insects needed to degrade 
or compost biodegradable materials [9]. While some skilled 
labourers undergo minimal interference, merely providing 
naturally occurring substances (formal subsumption), others 
are subjected to more intensive modifications to amplify their 
outputs (real subsumption). The latter can be seen in bacte-
ria engineered to mass-produce specific resistance genes for 
plasmid construction. In contrast to the primary biological 
labourers, the contribution of specific skills labourers is less 
likely to be recognised. 
(3) Tool-based labourers Tool-based labourers are organisms 
or biological components that facilitate the control, manip-
ulation or handling of primary and skilled labourers. They 
are integral to the biodesign workflow, facilitating precise 
organismal or environmental manipulation. For one-off con-
tributors, they often undergo formal subsumption, where 
their naturally occurring substances are harnessed directly. 
Examples in biodesign/HCI include the oats that serve as a 
conditioning tool to guide slime mould behaviours in living 
computers [1], the rice plant or barley behind vinegar as a pH 
regulator in bioplastic fabrication [74], and, in our case study 
hot spring bacteria providing heat resistant polymerase for 
genetic assembly. Real subsumption often happens in con-
stant producers, which are modified to optimise production 
of specific valuable ‘tools’. For example, polymerase enzymes are often mass produced through recombinant bacteria. How-
ever, the common perception of tools and its often obscure 
nomenclature (serial numbers and barcodes) pose challenges 
in recognising its potential organismal source and labour. 
(4) Support and sustenance providers Support and suste-
nance providers are the often-overlooked labourers that sup-
ply the essential nutrients and life-conducive environments 
to maintain the primary and skilled labourers, ensuring on-
going viability of production. Tracing the network of suste-
nance is often an expansive exercise. As mentioned above, 
culture media often includes a range of animal-, plant- and 
microorganism- derived components, linking the reproduc-
tion of laboratory cell lines to the wider agricultural ecosys-
tem. Substances such as peptone and yeast extract used in the 
case study are also widely used in biodesign/HCI practices 
for mycelium cultivation [13]. Formal subsumption occurs 
when these organisms are simply harvested for their natural 
outputs, while real subsumption involves significant modifi-
cation to maximise production, such as intensively farmed 
oil palm or recombinant bacteria that mass-produce rBSA. 
The extensive extraction and repurposing of their metabolic 
labour highlight how many biotechnological processes are 
fundamentally fuelled by their ‘reproductive labour’. 
(5) Evaluation and feedback labourers Evaluation and feed-
back labourers provide crucial responses and data that in-
form and refine experimental or design decisions. The visibil-
ity of feedback labourers depends on their role in the experi-
ment. In the case study, it took a rather unassuming form, 
such as bacteria and viruses that supply DNA sequences for 
gene ladders used in gel electrophoresis. When testing is 
the main goal of the experiment, the feedback labourers be-
come the primary labourers, examples can be seen in rabbits 
historically used for pregnancy tests, and horseshoe crab 
used in vaccine tests. In the wider biodesign practice, we 
can see feedback labourers mostly in forms of biosensing, 
such as bacteria engineered to signal environmental change 
[18]. In this case, real subsumption involves the modification 
of these organisms’ genome or entire living conditions to 
enhance their feedback capabilities. 
8 Discussion 
8.1
 Revealing more-than-human ecologies 
As we browse through catalogues of biological resources2 , we learn 
about what organisms, cells and biological components can do for 
a biodesign experiment and research. We learn that certain types 
of bacteria can change or gain vivid colours under particular cir-
cumstances, that, under certain conditions, mycelium spores can 
grow into a designated shape, and that the DNA of yeast cells can 
be modified with the help of certain substances to encode particular 
information. Detached from their context, there is a tendency for 
designers to not think about what could have driven these organ-
isms to behave this way: what kinds of physical pressures they 
have endured and what kind of environmental interactions they 
became accustomed to in order to sharpen or gain these features.

This detachment hides the first level of labour these organisms have 
performed in order to achieve what we now deem valuable for a 
particular design: the bodily work that underlies their quest for 
survival. 
As we uncover the hidden layers of living organisms that ex-
isted behind disembodied laboratory components, we also uncover 
their histories and recognise their interconnections with the wider 
world. The multitude of roles organisms play in laboratory practices 
(from primary production to serving as tools to manipulate other 
organisms) reflects a deeper reality: we are not merely co-opting 
individual organisms and their productive capabilities but also ap-
propriating a network of relationships in the more-than-human 
world - from the antibiotic resistance race carried out by different 
types of bacteria and the flows of sustenance from microbes to 
animals, to the llama’s immunological aptness against surrounding 
pathogens. Within our framework, we can recognise that life is 
interconnected and exists as much in a virus quasi cell as in the 
colours of sea anemone, and fetal serum of the calf that will never 
be. Indeed, we can understand our experiment as effectively es-
tablishing a wholly new ecology across humans, animals, plants, 
microbes and viruses - an ecology mediated by some humans in 
western industrialised countries (that is, us, and the many others 
that contributed to mass-produce biolab tools and components) and 
which would probably never have existed outside of this mediation. 
This new ecology, however, is still dependent on the original ecolo-
gies which these organisms have evolved into, and which created 
the features that allowed our experiment to take place. What our 
labour provenance approach does is to reveal these interdepen-
dencies, placing them within a noninnocent [25] perspective of 
utilitarianism, value creation, and/or capitalist production, a per-
spective that is prominent in our compromised existence [103] and 
which is increasingly stretching to all corners of the world. 
The detachment created by the transformation of the living into 
laboratory components prevents us from acknowledging and cel-
ebrating the many ways in which these organisms support the 
sustenance, tools and primary production that enable our practices 
to take place. It leads us to seeing our practice as a combination 
of biological products and features rather than an intervention 
into, and creation of, new ecologies. The labour provenance lens 
gives us tools to reflect, evaluate and question these new ecologies 
within a wider context, emphasising the many forms of intercon-
nected labour that more-than-humans perform, and the extent to 
which each individual organism is contributing to essential design 
processes through metabolic, resistance and/or sustenance labour, 
regardless of their species, or whether they provide an one-off or a 
continuous contribution. 
In our labour provenance map, viruses, bacteria, mammals and 
plants all play a role within new and existing ecologies. While 
there might be a temptation to place more emphasis on the work 
of specific animals - and research shows that humans tend to more 
readily empathise with and consider the ethical implications of 
beings that are more similar to them or more present in their daily 
lives [76] - we argue that the more distant species are from our direct 
empathic sensibilities, the more important it becomes for us to apply 
conceptual theories to rehabilitate the recognition of their value. 
This approach is crucial because the emotional proximity between 
specific organisms and humans doesn’t necessarily correlate with the extent to which they are interconnected. In other words, the 
danger of overlooking ‘less-appealing’ organisms is that it prevents 
us from identifying the crucial interdependent relations between 
charismatic and less charismatic species, and indeed humanity’s 
own interdependencies with these often-overlooked lifeforms. 
In HCI, there is a significant amount of work done with bac-
teria [60, 83, 121], fungi [34, 62, 114], and plants [16, 46, 47, 54], 
alongside wild and domestic animals in Animal-Computer Inter-
action (ACI) [45, 71, 72]. Recent research has started to explore 
critical approaches to engaging microorganisms in research, in-
cluding with focus on microbial temporality [8], unmaking [7] and 
non-participation [17]. These demographics of more-than-human 
organisms involved in design and HCI practices demand a more 
holistic approach in labour analysis that focuses on interconnec-
tions [36] rather than individual species. 
They also invite new ways of honouring the contribution of these 
organisms. As Despret discusses in Are any species killable? [26], 
the way of "honouring" the labour and sacrifice of lab organisms "re-
mains to be invented", particularly within western lab conventions. 
Other cultural practices, such as Japan’s longstanding memorial 
services for lab animals (Ireisai ) [51] and more recently, synthetic 
cells [52], point to existing ritualistic approaches that celebrate 
more-than-human contributions to research. Although predomi-
nantly focusing on primary contributors, these practices lay an 
important moral foundation for future forms of labour recognition 
that include a broader acknowledgement of the myriad shadow 
organism labourers and their ecologies. 
8.2 Expanding notions of ‘sustainability’ in 
biodesign 
Sustainability in biodesign is often framed as a natural outcome 
of working with living organisms, leveraging their capability to 
self-generate, adapt to different environments, and eventually biode-
grade. Indeed, while it may appear that biodesign inherently aligns 
with sustainable principles due to its use of “natural” components, 
the reality is that it not only can replicate unsustainable patterns 
seen in traditional design and production, but also render itself 
more controversial, in the extent that it appropriates other organ-
isms’ capacities. The reproduction, maintenance, and growth of 
living systems in biodesign rely on extensive ecological networks 
and on living and non-living inputs, many of which are themselves 
products of industrial processes with significant environmental 
impact and/or extraction from an array of organismal labour. The 
complexity and multitude of more-than-human labour and its as-
sociated modes of production shown in this paper reveals that 
the sustainability of biodesign is inherently contingent on its wide 
ecologies of more-than-human labour and on its level of integration 
into industrial systems. 
In her opening keynote at CHI 2024, Kate Crawford reiterated 
the need to focus on the materiality of artificial intelligence (AI) 
[23]. Through tracing the significant material cost behind the de-
velopment of large language models (from environmental degra-
dation to underpaid crowd labour), she redefines the impact scale 
of the seemingly ephemeral concept of AI. In particular, she men-
tions the mutually reinforcing methods of ‘abstraction’, ‘distraction’ 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chen et al. 
and ’extraction’ of AI - that is, the abstracted images and disem-
bodied analogies associated with AI, which remove it from the 
‘earthly resources needed to produce it’, and distract people from the 
power structures it originates from and thus reinforces. As such, 
abstraction and distraction lead to a sense of ignorance and further 
smoothens and exacerbates AI’s associated resource and labour 
extraction. 
Similarly, we contend that applications and methods of biological 
HCI can become an abstraction, distraction and extraction of the 
actual labour performed by different organisms involved in the 
research and production process. The abstraction of life through 
labelled components can distract researchers from the actual life-
cost to produce them and exacerbate extraction of value from their 
bodily works and the wider labour ecologies that they are entangled 
with. 
By providing a case study on labour provenance, we call for a 
more expansive perspective on sustainability - one that goes be-
yond visible and charismatic organisms to include all entities and 
the broader ecological implications of design. This approach calls 
for a holistic view that scrutinises every component and process 
involved in sustaining life, including the substances sourced to 
sustain biodesign practices and the environmental toll of lab oper-
ations. Only by accounting for these interconnected costs can we 
move towards genuinely sustainable practices that do not merely 
reinscribe the extractive logics from conventional anthropocentric 
design. 
8.3 Labour as a lens for discussing 
more-than-human design ethics 
Applying a labour provenance lens allows us to critically expand the 
boundaries of what can be seen and critically analysed in biodesign. 
As the discussion in the workshop regarding ‘how to be a better 
boss for more-than-human labourers’ reveals, there is often a strug-
gle in conceiving of ethical treatments in certain types of organisms. 
As mentioned above, humans tend to more readily empathise with 
species that can be seen as having human traits, and traditional 
ethical frameworks often rely on biological traits such as pain per-
ception or cognitive complexities as guard rails of moral relevance 
[95, 104], naturally leading to a focus on mammals. In contrast, 
environmental humanities, and posthumanist discourse suggest 
alternative approaches, emphasising the possibilities to establish 
ethical relevance through roles and contribution in ecosystems [27], 
interdependencies [92] and/or care relations [25, 28]. Viewed from 
the latter frameworks, the discovery of interconnected forms of 
labour in biodesign practices possesses significant ethical implica-
tions. 
By evaluating the levels of subsumption exerted on organisms, 
we can assess the involvement of organisms in the design process, 
acknowledging whether their contributions are justified within 
a spectrum of capitalist value production that could vary from 
no subsumption, to formal and finally real subsumption. No sub-
sumption would mean a form of design outside capitalist modes 
- a relationship to the more-than-human that does not imply any 
reproduction, scaling, added value or commercialisation. Formal 
subsumption could be identified as design practices that attempt to 
reward organisms by giving them optimal environments to produce valuable responses or substances, while real subsumption would 
take place when organisms’ functions are changed, optimised or 
scaled up to sustain a particular design. 
A great part of current HCI research into more-than-human 
or multispecies design seems to inhabit a space between no sub-
sumption and formal subsumption. Such practices emphasise in-
terdependency and the ethical imperative to meet the needs of 
the organisms, mostly considering the creation of non-commercial 
research value, including educational, artistic and discursive out-
comes. However, in these cases, organisms may still be subjected 
to human-defined goals, even when efforts are made to balance the 
contribution of more-than-human organisms with care and coexis-
tence. By applying the labour lenses, and indeed by simply calling 
their participation "labour", we allow for a different discussion to 
emerge - one that could stress conflicting goals and potentially 
implicit anthropocentric agendas, as well as reveal ways of improv-
ing organismal welfare. As environments become more controlled, 
and techniques more interventional, however, there is an increased 
potential to move towards real subsumption (such as in the case of 
microorganisms in the biolab practices described above, but also 
more advanced forms of biological HCI) potentially leaving little 
space for organisms’ interest or resistance beyond designated value 
creation. In this case, the framework allows us to critically evaluate 
the extent to which a design activity or a biological experiment 
subsumes the living processes of more-than-human organisms and 
its ecological context for the benefit of production. 
While our work focuses on living labour and its surrounding 
ecologies, it may also invite reflections on the non-living. As tech-
nology advances, distinctions between the living and the non-living 
become blurred: while living organisms become more "designed", 
machines become more autonomous, akin to living things. Here, we 
argue that the labour framework can help us shift the focus from 
simple notions of autonomy to what is underlying such behaviours. 
We could say that, while living organisms possess their own gen-
erative agendas – e.g. to stay alive, reproduce, resist dominance – 
that can be co-opted into systems of production, the agendas of 
non-living agents such as machines and algorithms, as discussed by 
Crawford [ 23], are intrinsically connected to human-defined func-
tions and systems of power. This way, while living organisms move 
from autonomy to real subsumption, machines and algorithms that 
manifest elements of autonomy move from real subsumption to 
autonomy. As such, the labour carried out by living organisms (and 
the ethical implications of extracting value from this labour) can be 
considered as intrinsically different. Indeed, as we move towards 
more entangled forms of living and non-living labour, there is a 
need for further investigation into the wider ecologies of labour, 
materials, and sustenance, the forms of control to which these are 
subjected, and how they are embedded within system of production. 
Furthermore, while the labour framework enriches our under-
standing of organismal contributions and structural positions within 
design, we must also acknowledge that it still only addresses part 
of organisms’ identity, which may overlook wider ecological roles, 
intrinsic values, the relevance of these organisms beyond systems of 
production, and more complex entanglements with the non-living. 
To fully unfold the implications of different modes of labour 
subsumption, we need to understand the origins and forms of work 
Labour Provenance as a Lens to Reveal More-Than-Human Ecologies in Biological Design and HCI CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
that are being subsumed. In the human context, the shift from for-
mal subsumption to real subsumption significantly changes socio-
economic structures and workers’ relations with their means of 
production. In the context of ‘employing’ living processes and em-
bodied work, different modes of subsumption can directly alter 
more-than-human workers’ ecological relations, bodies, metabo-
lism and genomes. As biodesign practices increasingly harness 
and reshape the living processes of organisms, the identification 
of labouring or value-generating processes becomes the crux of 
unravelling the locus of productionist control and assessing the 
ethical dimensions of these interventions. 
In sum, the labour provenance framework provides a way to 
interrogate the potential ethical implications of biodesign, asking 
if the level of control over organisms is commensurable to the con-
sequential benefit, and what could be done to improve conditions 
within these practices, even if ways to interpret these questions can 
vary, as indeed is the case amongst the authors of this paper. Rather 
than a set of guidelines on how to proceed, it is a way to leverage 
reflection on the many expressions of life, their interdependences, 
and the mediation of these interdependencies within our created 
worlds. 
9 Conclusion 
In this paper we have applied ‘labour provenance’ as a lens to un-
cover the network of more-than-human organisms implicated in 
a biodesign case study. We translated this approach into a work-
shop to facilitate reflection on hidden organism labourers and the 
spectrum of inclination towards ethical reflection on organisms’ 
contribution. The analysis and reflections led to the definition of a 
framework to help designers investigate and analyse more-than-
human labourers and which can help us question underlying power 
dynamics beyond the immediate relationship between designer and 
primary organisms. We propose the concept of labour provenance 
as a way to foster a discussion on more ethical approaches to biode-
sign that can acknowledge all contributing life forms. The multitude 
of uncovered organisms problematise the inherent notion of sus-
tainability in biodesign and calls for a view that situates practices 
within the wider interconnected ecosystems and industrial produc-
tion. Ultimately, this expansive perspective challenges us to rethink 
what it means to engage with living systems in design and to strive 
for practices that honour the full complexity and interdependence 
of our more-than-human world.
