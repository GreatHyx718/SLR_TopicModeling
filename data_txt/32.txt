ABSTRACT
What if artificial intelligence (AI) could transform academic writ-
ing into an exhilarating game of table tennis? This paper explores
AI’s potential to foster creativity, enjoyment, and play. We chal-
lenge the view of AI as merely a tool for efficiency, showcasing
its capacity for embodied interaction and intellectual engagement.
We introduce an AI-infused table tennis setup, where two people
can co-author a paper while playing ping pong. Using ChatGPT
and an Arduino-driven system, this environment generates writing
prompts based on gameplay, blending physical play with intellec-
tual practice. Through PingPonGPT, we demonstrate AI’s role in
reflective practices, enriching overall work and creative processes.

1 INTRODUCTION
As AI technologies proliferate, their integration into our daily lives
often emphasizes efficiency and output, overshadowing the poten-
tial for these systems to foster creativity, enjoyment, and play. In
the public and industrial imagination, GenAI seems to be perceived
as a technology that will eventually remove the need for cognitive
and bodily engagement of humans with work, except for typing
in a few words or uttering phrases while looking at some form of
screen. This screen-based, desk-bound, and mobile-yet-stationary
future envisioned for human-AI interactions appears as a remnant
of the outdated ideals of interaction design [ 18]. This kind of future
might be interpreted as the only way that will move us towards
utility and productivity. But does it really have to be so?
We argue that GenAI can actually be a valuable tool to explore
novel ways of embodied interaction through play where body and
mind act as a whole [ 14]. In this paper, we propose an unconven-
tional reflective practice with AI, focusing on the concept of play.

HTTF ’24, October 21–23, 2024, Santa Cruz, CA, USA Börütecene & Buruk
We designed and conducted a study that combines physical play
with intellectual engagement through AI. More specifically, we
used ChatGPT to transform table tennis into an activity where two
people can simultaneously play pingpong and write an academic
paper. In this setup driven by Arduino, the positioning of the ball
on the table generates various prompts for ChatGPT, thus creating
a dynamic and interactive experience as two "players" bounce ideas
back and forth. This system enabled us to engage, using our whole
body, in creative dialogues with ChatGPT, influenced both by inten-
tional prompts and spontaneous ones triggered by our gameplay [ 3].
Through this playful and embodied approach, we seek to reflect on
the potential of AI to reshape our work environments and challenge
conventional methods of academic writing. Our study contributes to
the ongoing discourse on reflective practices in Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI) and design, particularly by examining how AI
can cultivate a playful and engaging work atmosphere.
2 WRITING, PLAYFUL WORK, AND
REFLECTIVE PRACTICES WITH AI
Writing is usually associated with desks and sedentary positions,
with silence and immobility considered necessary [ 9]. Writing on
smartphones while walking or driving is both difficult and unsafe
[22,30]. While a non-distracting environment and comfortable
positions help for some parts of writing, they do not necessitate
stillness or completely isolated environments free from distraction
[6]. Historically, writing has involved the whole body in expressive
motion, as seen in some Asian cultures. [ 11,12,16,31]. This shows
writing can be dynamic, merging physical movement with cognitive
effort.
The role of playfulness in work and creative processes has been
explored across various disciplines. Play is recognized as crucial
for human development, creativity, and well-being [ 1,15]. Integrat-
ing play into professional environments is increasingly important
today, as playful activities foster a state of flow, enhancing creativ-
ity and productivity [ 17]. Digital technologies and AI-driven play
environments further create opportunities for playful interactions,
enhancing work contexts and challenging conventional notions of
writing and productivity [21, 32].
Building on this background, integrating table tennis with aca-
demic writing serves as a case study for embodied interaction
through AI. This innovative approach merges playfulness with
the productivity demands of academic work, pushing traditional
boundaries. Donald Schön’s concept of reflective practice [ 27], in-
volving self-dialogue during an activity, is relevant here, and his
ideas of "reflection-in-action" and "reflection-on-action" are partic-
ularly meaningful. By engaging in playful, embodied activities like
table tennis while doing intellectual work supported by AI, partici-
pants continuously reflect and adapt, deepening understanding and
yielding innovative outcomes.
3 BOUNCING IDEAS: PINGPONGPT
To explore AI’s potential to infuse play into work practices, we
integrated a physical game with an AI conversation agent in our
study. We transformed a ping-pong table into PingPonGPT with
an Arduino-driven sensor system interacting with ChatGPT (see
Figure 1 above). Table tennis (an activity previously studied in HCIfrom a different perspective [ 19]), chosen for its playfulness, had
sensors detecting the ball’s position and triggering prompts. Two
force sensors placed in each player’s zone on the table activated
pre-programmed prompts, such as "Be critical about the topic we
are currently discussing" As we played and brainstormed, Chat-
GPT continuously listened to our conversation and joined in as
well as responded to these prompts when triggered, ensuring our
discussions remained dynamic and intellectually stimulating. The
ChatGPT output was shown on the laptop screen and read out loud
via external speakers as it was generated. Although our conversa-
tion got disrupted or deviated time to time because of turn-taking
challenges due to sensor activation and the technical fidelity of our
prototype, this did not prevent us from engaging in an inspiring
and fruitful conversation through this AI-driven system.
In the PingPonGPT system, hitting the ball intertwined with
idea exchange, with each rally enhancing both physical engage-
ment and brainstorming. When the ball landed on designated spots,
ChatGPT verbally posed probing questions or new perspectives,
integrating the game into our writing workflow. This setup rede-
fined table tennis from a physical activity into a key element of
our collaborative intellectual endeavor. During an approximately
two-hour pilot session around the theme "Reflective practices with
AI", we generated a 25-page transcript [ 4], later used by a ChatGPT
assistant to help craft this paper1. PingPonGPT allowed intentional
and spontaneous interactions, fostering a continuous feedback loop
and demonstrating AI’s potential to create engaging, playful work
environments. Here we report on our firsthand experience with this
system [ 8], which aims to share impressions and learnings from
this non-idiomatic interaction [23].
4 OBSERVATIONS AND INSIGHTS
Our interaction with ChatGPT, while engaging in a physical game
of table tennis, yielded rich insights into the dynamics of integrating
playfulness with intellectual tasks:
Integration of Physical Play and Intellectual Work: Our
experience from the PingPonGPT setup suggested that physical
play and intellectual work can be mutually reinforcing. In playing
table tennis, we generated ideas and writing prompts inspired by
our gameplay, enhancing creativity and dynamism (even after a
sleepless night of developing PingPonGPT). This setup challenged
the sedentary nature of academic writing, indicating that physical
activities can coexist with high mental focus tasks. It also allowed us
to express and share our ideas more freely, avoiding the usual con-
straints of formal, sedentary academic discussions and prolonged
screen focus: Author 1 (and the player 1 in our case) noted that
while one person was speaking, the other could focus on the ball,
creating a dynamic and graceful conversational environment. This
engaging method enhanced conversational depth and collaborative
synergy while preventing screen fatigue and stifled spontaneity.
Embodied and Playful Experiences: In our experiment, we
experienced an intriguing blend of physical and cognitive engage-
ment with our PingPonGPT setup. This approach challenged the
conventional work environment, transforming writing into an ac-
tivity that was both physically invigorating and intellectually stim-
ulating. The physicality of the game, combined with AI-generated

responses, created a multi-sensory experience that was refreshing
and thought-provoking. The playful nature of the study enhanced
motivation, making the intellectual task of writing more enjoyable.
One author noted that using pressure sensors on the table intro-
duced an extra challenge, enhancing the game’s fun. This gamified
element, requiring us to hit sensors to trigger prompts, kept us
motivated and intrigued, fostering heightened engagement and
creativity. This approach made the writing process both physically
and intellectually exhilarating.
Enhancing Creativity through Random Prompts: Integrat-
ing table tennis with ChatGPT added an element of serendipity
to the writing process—like the title that comes from a whimsical
ChatGPT story about Dr.Ping and Dr.Pong writing a paper while
playing table tennis. Random prompts, generated by the ball’s posi-
tion, often led us to think outside the box and fostered creativity.
The unpredictability of these prompts encouraged us to explore new
ideas and perspectives, breaking free from conventional thought
patterns. One author noted that ChatGPT receiving a prompt from
the table generated immediate responses, which provided com-
pelling moments for reflection and redirection during the game.
These sensor-triggered interruptions prevented us from getting too
entrenched in a single line of thought, facilitating a dynamic and
adaptive creative process.
AI as a Collaborative Entity: The interaction with ChatGPT
evolved from simply receiving information to collaborating with
an AI entity. Initially, the AI’s responses were generic, but over
time, they became more nuanced, showcasing its potential as a
creative partner. One of the authors noted the extended interaction
duration due to the game, which allowed the AI to provide more
tailored and interesting responses as the conversation deepened.
Additionally, the engagement with PingPonGPT kept us involved
in the creative process for a longer time than traditional writing
methods would. One author emphasized that without the game
component, the prolonged and enriched interaction with the AI
would not have been possible, highlighting that the experiment
has potential for further exploration of AI-enhanced embodied
play for more enjoyable work environments. By transforming from
a mere information source to a dynamic collaborator, ChatGPT
significantly enriched the creative process.
5 DISCUSSION
Our exploration with PingPonGPT reveals a broad spectrum of
insights connecting physical play, intellectual tasks, and AI-driven
reflective practices. This experiment demonstrates that the inte-
gration of physical activities with intellectual efforts has potential
to foster engagement and creativity within the work environment.
However, it also highlights several critical reflections about the
feasibility, cognitive load, and the balance required for effectively
harnessing such hybrid systems.
5.1 Engagement and Creativity Boosted through
AI-Supported Embodied Play
The physical act of playing table tennis while engaging in aca-
demic writing introduced a unique form of embodied cognition.
This interplay between a dynamic physical activity and a reflective
intellectual task leveraged multiple sensory modalities, the jointaction of mind and body, and random input for serendipity, thereby
fostering a richer creative process [ 25]. Previous studies substan-
tiate that engaging in physical activities can stimulate cognitive
functions, such as concentration, memory, and problem-solving
skills [ 24,26]. Our findings align with this, as we experienced a
comfortable flow of creative ideas, facilitated by the spontaneous
prompts generated through gameplay, which broke conventional
thought patterns and led to fresh perspectives.
5.2 Balancing Intellectual and Physical
Demands
Integrating pressure sensors with varying sensitivity into the table
could enhance interaction, feedback, and input while writing a
paper. For example, light ball taps could signal to ChatGPT or the
other player which topic or section to discuss or ideate on, without
displaying visual content. While the study underscores the potential
for synergy between physical activity and intellectual work, it
also exposes inherent challenges. The primary concern revolves
around cognitive load and the risk of fragmentation of thought
processes. Writing an academic paper demands deep, sustained
focus and critical thinking. Simultaneously playing a high-energy
game like table tennis potentially disrupts this flow, that might
lead to to cognitive overload and a decrease in overall productivity
when diverse conditions and different cognitive abilities of different
people are taken into account [29].
5.3 Critical Evaluation of Reflective Practices
with PingPonGPT
Donald Schön’s ideas on reflective practice—“reflection-in-action”
and “reflection-on-action”—offer an apt framework for examin-
ing this study’s outcomes [ 28]. Engaging in PingPonGPT allowed
for real-time reflection ("reflection-in-action"), where the prompts
during play provided immediate feedback and encouraged ongo-
ing adaptation. This setup also facilitated post-session reflection
("reflection-on-action"), where the dynamic interplay between play
and work offered a space for "inquiry" [ 2] where we reviewed and
enhanced our understanding of both academic writing and physical
play. From a slow technology point of view, PingPonGPT might be
considered as a piece of reflective design that amplifies time, extend-
ing the duration of interaction with ChatGPT through a physical
and spatial structure based on repetitive and gradual steps [13].
However, a crucial critical observation is the potential for in-
terruptions to stifle deep reflective processes due to the disjointed
nature of frequent prompts. Initial interactions with pre-defined
prompts were mundane and slightly disruptive to the creative flow.
Over time, as the context evolved, even repetitive prompts began to
yield meaningful dialogue. Through the dimensions of reflective in-
formatics, these disruptions might be interpreted as "breakdowns"
that marks moments for reflection [ 2]. It became evident that the
quality and relevance of these AI-generated prompts critically in-
fluenced the overall quality of the reflective practice. This paper is
an artefact of what such engagement with PingPonGPT, and with
other similar playful systems, might produce in one session of play
and writing. However, iterating on this by feeding our current work
into the system and continuing our collaboration with PingPonGPT
HTTF ’24, October 21–23, 2024, Santa Cruz, CA, USA Börütecene & Buruk
over a longer period (e.g., weeks or months) would most proba-
bly produce a paper that engaged more deeply with the topic and
resulted in a higher quality outcome.
5.4 AI and More-Than-Human Ways of Writing
Our study also highlighted transformative potentials for AI as a
collaborative entity in intellectual tasks. Initially, the AI’s responses
were generic, but as the session progressed, and deeper engage-
ment ensued, the AI’s contributions became more nuanced and
contextually relevant. This evolution underscores AI’s potential
as a dynamic partner in the creative process [ 7] when allowed
to engage fully, building on previous work which used ChatGPT
for producing academic papers in limited time [ 4]. While Chat-
GPT as a non-human actant in this setup reduces human players’
control over the ideation and writing process, this might result in
fruitful creative thinking as it offers a sort of balance between struc-
tural connectedness (ordered thinking) and imaginative divergence
(chaotic thinking) [ 10]. An intriguing aspect of PingPonGPT is that
it comprises two completely different spheres of activities/realities
but still produces a meaningful outcome in both (i.e., having a ping
pong match and producing a draft paper), which indicates a pos-
sible use of GenAI for sublime, almost magical cross-reality work
experiences [5].
Nevertheless, integrating AI prompts into an interactive physical
environment raises substantial questions about the balance between
assistance and disruption. Poorly timed or excessive prompts could
become intrusive rather than constructive, highlighting the need for
systems that are context-aware and capable of providing adaptive
and personalized prompts [ 20]. For example, PingPonGPT resulted
in a fruitful conversational interaction by voice, but turn-taking
appeared as a challenge because ChatGPT’s responses were getting
interrupted by the ball hitting on the sensors. This created some
frustration on our side at times (especially when wanted to hear
more about an aspect ChatGPT was talking about) and disruption in
the conversation flow, which is something that we plan to address
in the next iteration of the prototype.
6 CONCLUSION
This study illustrates AI’s potential to transform traditional writing
methods by integrating physical play with intellectual work. Our
PingPonGPT setup demonstrates how AI can enhance creativity,
engagement, and reflective practices through non-verbal communi-
cation and coordinated movement. By merging table tennis with
academic writing, we showed that AI-driven environments can re-
vitalize work processes, making them more dynamic and enjoyable.
