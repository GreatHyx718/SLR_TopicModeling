Abstract
Flush toilets pose challenges such as resource waste, public health,
and social justice. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goal
of clean water and sanitation for all, it is essential to address the
complex issues around toilets and design alternative systems that ef-
fectively manage human waste. Inspired by Actor-Network Theory
(ANT), this paper presents findings from a design ethnography in
eco-villages about composting toilets and sustainable living. We de-
scribe three archetypal composting toilet systems and examine how
they operate as creative, community-driven infrastructures that me-
diate human–nature relationships. We reflect on how ANT provides
a useful lens for HCI to understand the socio-technical dynamics of
alternative sanitation systems. We analyse how composting toilets
mediate human-nature relations three interconnected processes:
tinkering, linking, and becoming. We discuss the implications of
fostering DIY infrastructure practices as a form of transformational
creativity in the pursuit of more sustainable futures.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3698061.3726922in everyday life [ 17]. However, most projects still adopt a human-
centred perspective, which can result in exploitative relations with
materials and the natural environment. Hence, the need to explore
ways to transform human-nature relations and engage people in
regenerative actions that go beyond a human-centric approach
[55]. This paper employs Actor-Network Theory [ 30] as a lens to
examine composting toilets and sustainable living in eco-villages
to uncover how creative practices can mediate the relationship
between humans and non-humans in sustainable living.
Despite the flush toilet’s status as a symbol of modern civili-
sation, it faces challenges such as the waste of fresh water and
humanure, and approximately 2 billion people worldwide lack ac-
cess to safe sanitation systems due to the high infrastructure costs
of flush toilets [ 59]. Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to en-
sure the "availability and sustainable management of water and
sanitation for all" [ 51]. Flush toilets should not be the only option,
especially in rural areas and locations with limited freshwater re-
sources. Researchers and designers need to explore non-sewage
alternative systems that can provide a hygienic and comfortable toi-
leting experience, avoid excrement pollution, and utilise humanure
locally.
In modern society, sanitation systems are usually invisible, dis-
connecting people from nature. The water supply and sewers in
urban areas are often hidden underground, and individuals do not
participate in the decision-making process regarding the water
source and sewage treatment. This isolation can make people un-
aware of the impact of their behaviours on the environment. Making
the invisible infrastructure visible and reconnecting people to na-
ture is crucial to foster sustainable lifestyles towards a regenerative
future.
The creative redesign of essential infrastructure like toilets rep-
resents a form of transformational creativity [ 7] that challenges
dominant paradigms and reimagines human relationships with
waste. Unlike incremental innovations that might make flush toi-
lets more water-efficient, composting toilets fundamentally recon-
figure the human waste cycle, transforming a linear process of
waste and pollution into a circular system of resource regeneration.
This transformation involves not just technical innovation but a
cognitive reframing of human-nature relations, advocating for col-
laborative entanglements and mutual care, rather than competition
or extraction.
Recent research has focused on decentralising humans in design
by promoting alternative practices that ensure fairness and justice

for both humans and non-human entities (e.g. [ 4,13,40]). Revis-
iting traditional human-centred approaches, these studies assert
that design is exploitative in non-human species and resources [ 55].
Advocates for these perspectives seek to implement practices that
prioritise equity for all beings [ 18], proposing alternatives to hier-
archical control models [ 33], innovation at societal margins [ 31],
nomadic practices [ 54], and sustainable place-making strategies
[47]. This posthumanism viewpoint aims to investigate the broader
systemic interactions rather than merely focusing on interfaces,
revealing the full complexity of these relationships [ 23]. The signifi-
cance of this perspective lies in its ability to offer design approaches
that are both objectively grounded and intricately detailed in spe-
cific contexts [ 54]. Actor-Network Theory posits that humans and
non-humans are equally influential actors, co-constructing and co-
evolving with one another. This theory is instrumental in analysing
the intricate networks formed through the interactions between
human and non-human participants, elucidating how technologies
can be assigned roles to regulate, influence, or even substitute cer-
tain human behaviours [ 16]. ANT’s value here lies in its ability
to trace the heterogeneous associations - linking human practices,
natural elements like microbes and soil, technical artefacts like toi-
lets, and community values - that constitute sustainable sanitation,
moving beyond purely social or technical explanations.
This paper presents findings from a design ethnography of com-
posting toilets and sustainable living in eco-villages in remote Aus-
tralia. This paper illustrates three types of composting toilets and
describes how they mediate the relationships between humans and
non-humans. By interacting with non-human actors such as human
waste, microbes, soil, and plants, people redesign the impact of their
behaviour on the environment and reconstruct the decision-making
processes of community living. Composting toilets open new av-
enues for design research to explore how to reconnect humans
with nature and transform everyday activities towards regenera-
tive futures. We introduce the concepts of Tinkering ,Linking , and
Becoming to analyse how these DIY systems foster creative engage-
ment and mediate human-nature relations. The paper reflects on
the role of composting toilets in sustainable living and discusses
how ANT can help understand their implications for fostering DIY
infrastructure practices and transformational creativity.

2.1 Sustainable HCI and Transformational
Creativity
Sustainable HCI has consistently focused on sustainability in ev-
eryday life (e.g. [ 12,36,58]). Researchers have pointed out that
people’s daily choices and actions are crucial for sustainable prac-
tices [ 37,46] and have emphasised the need to reflect on how we
are influenced and shaped as environmental actors [ 14]. Håkansson
and Phoebe [ 21] argue that sustainable living should be associated
with a higher quality of life, and design can motivate family and
community interaction and communication through the theme of
"enough". Heitlinger et al. [ 24,25], through their study of grass-
roots food-growing communities, have challenged the approach of
designing solely for individual consumer choices, offering a possi-
bility for achieving a sustainable future through collective action.
They advocate for designing environmental conservation efforts byinvolving more people in food growing, waste recycling, and the
sharing of knowledge and skills within the community [ 24]. Norton
et al. [ 39] emphasise the importance of value elicitation in designing
digital technology through their research in permaculture commu-
nities. Furthermore, this field encompasses various similar research
and practices, such as computational agroecology [ 42], ecological
thinking [ 6,41], urban informatics [ 19,20], home organisation [ 52],
DIY practices [ 47,49,50,53], and cohabitation with non-human be-
ings [ 33,34,45] — that seek to reconfigure human-nature relations
toward ecological attunement and long-term sustainability.
While exploratory creativity works within established concep-
tual spaces and combinational creativity merges familiar ideas,
transformational creativity fundamentally changes the rules and
constraints of a conceptual space [ 7]. Boden [ 7] posits transfor-
mational creativity as a process involving radical changes to a
conceptual space, leading to ideas or artefacts that could not have
been generated within the original space. As Light et al. [ 32] ar-
gue, sustainable futures demand not just new technologies, but new
imaginary, values, and ways of being. In recent years, a trend in HCI
has started to question the traditional human-centred notion (e.g.
[4,6,10,56]), drawing inspiration from posthumanism to broaden
ethical and relational considerations in design.
Haraway, in her book Staying with the Trouble [22], further de-
scribes humans as "companion species," emphasising that humans
coexist with billions of symbionts, especially within our bodies. She
argues that the world we inhabit is a web of interconnected rela-
tionships, and as actors, we have a collective ethical obligation to
influence this web [ 22]. Forlano [ 18] connects posthumanism with
design, highlighting that non-human beings are also stakeholders in
design. The focus is on how design can support the needs and values
of non-human entities, from soil microbes to infrastructures, that
have often been overlooked in anthropocentric frameworks. The
posthumanist perspective stresses the interdependence between
humans and all forms of life, advocating for collaborative entangle-
ments and mutual care, rather than competition or extraction.
2.2 Actor-Network Theory
Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is a framework that argues that ob-
jects participate in building heterogeneous networks that bring to-
gether actants of all types and sizes, whether human or non-human
[2]. This perspective suggests that society is a complex network
composed of these heterogeneous entities. The core concepts in this
framework include actant and heterogeneous network. An actant
is whatever acts or shifts actions. Action itself is defined by a list
of performances through trials, from which a set of competences
with which the actant is endowed can be deduced [ 3]. An actor is
an actant endowed with a character, often anthropomorphic [ 3].
A heterogeneous network brings together actants of all types and
sizes, human and non-human, highlighting the interconnectedness
facilitated by technical objects [ 3]. The principle within this view
is the examination of the relationships and interactions between
these actants, without pre-defining a distinction between the social
and the technical [ 8]. The focus is on understanding the conditions
and mechanisms under which the relations that define society and
knowledge are susceptible to partial reconstruction through these
681
Mediating the Human-Nature Relations by Composting Toilets C&C ’25, June 23–25, 2025, Virtual, United Kingdom
networks [ 30]. This approach challenges simple technological de-
terminism and social constructivism by paying attention to what
is brought together by the network and acknowledging the obdu-
racy of objects [ 9]. In this way, ANT reveals the often-overlooked
roles of the natural environment and objects, and other non-human
elements in everyday sustainable practices.
Translation is a key process in ANT where actors interact with
others to gradually integrate their own intentions and goals into
the network, thereby aligning the interests of other actors with
their own [ 29]. Callon pointed out that translation occurs through
four stages [ 8]:Problematisation : The focal actor defines the prob-
lem and identifies other actors whose identities and interests align
with its own, attempting to position itself as an indispensable role.
Interessement : The focal actor attempts to engage other participants
in the roles designated for them. Enrolment : The focal actor recruits
various actors into the network. Mobilisation : The focal actor en-
sures that its network acts as a spokesperson for the other actors.
These stages do not occur in a strict sequence but are interwoven.
Each stage achieved by an actor or innovator represents progress
in the ongoing negotiation process [ 8]. Sustainable HCI faces com-
plex and dynamic social and environmental challenges, requiring
the integration of the needs and interests of various actors. ANT
provides a framework that includes diverse actors, both human and
non-human, as well as technology and nature, in the understand-
ing and design process. By analysing the complex relationships
between actors in sustainable transitions from spatial and temporal
dimensions (e.g. [ 1,38,57]), ANT helps us go beyond a singular
focus on reducing environmental pollution, situating sustainable
practices within the ever-changing activities of various actors over
time. Compared to frameworks like Social Practice Theory [ 44],
which emphasises routines and shared understandings, ANT offers
a stronger lens for examining the specific roles of non-human actors
and the dynamic processes of network formation and stabilisation,
particularly useful for understanding the introduction and adoption
of novel socio-technical systems like composting toilets.
3 Methodology
This paper is based on design ethnography, a qualitative approach
to understand situated practices and the intricate relationships
between people, technologies, and their environments [ 11]. The
central concept of design ethnography is work , which refers to
the practical effort, skill, and competence required to accomplish
ordinary activities [ 11]. Design ethnography seeks to understand
what the work of a setting consists of, the activities members do,
and the assembly of ordinary activities [ 11]. The primary work
studied in this paper is how eco-village members manage their
sanitation through compositing toilets and integrate these DIY
infrastructure practices with other aspects of their lives and the
eco-village’s functioning. Design ethnography is suited to studying
socio-technical systems such as composting toilets, as it allows for
close attention to material practices, cultural meanings, and the
relational configurations that emerge between humans and non-
humans. Rather than merely documenting functional use, design
ethnography enables us to explore how users appropriate, adapt,
and co-construct ecological technologies through ongoing practices
of maintenance, negotiation, and care.3.1 Research Setting and Participants
The empirical material presented here draws from a long-term re-
search program on making, DIY practices, and sustainable living in
remote Australia, which has been ongoing since 2020. While the
broader research project involved 15 participants across multiple
eco-village contexts in Australia, this paper draws specifically on
data from four participants whose experiences offered the most
insight into the socio-material dynamics of composting toilet de-
sign, use, and maintenance. These cases were selected through
purposeful sampling for their conceptual richness, diversity of de-
sign approaches, and depth of interaction with the composting
systems.
Our aim in this paper is not to provide an exhaustive account of
all participant experiences, but rather to offer a thick description
of key practices, meanings, and relational patterns that emerged
through close engagement with a small number of cases. This ap-
proach is consistent with design ethnography and qualitative case-
based inquiry, where depth, context, and interpretive insight are
prioritised over breadth or statistical generalisation [ 11]. The re-
maining participant data have been analysed and presented in
other publications within the same research program, each paper
contributing to a different facet of sustainable design practices in
eco-villages [47–49].
For this paper, we focus specifically on the ethnographic field-
work conducted between 2020 and 2023 in remote Australian eco-
villages. We present three archetypal types of composting toilets
from two eco-villages. To protect participants’ privacy, we used
code to represent participants (e.g., P1, P2, P3, P4, representing key
informants identified during fieldwork in Table. 1) and eco-villages
(EV1-EV2).

Eco-Village 1 . EV1 was established in 2019 on a 3.48-acre prop-
erty under a not-for-profit land trust. During our first visit in 2020,
four adults and two children resided there. EV1 seeks to show-
case the benefits of a low-carbon, simple ‘home-based economy’
lifestyle, aiming to inspire broader cultural change. P1 and P2 are
working to create a community where people’s needs, such as con-
nection, recognition, trust, and mutuality, are fulfilled. They aspire
to empower everyone in the eco-village through active participa-
tion in making and self-governance. They view the eco-village as
a journey towards simplicity and minimalism, emphasising the
process over the destination, where participants can find spiritual
contentment and satisfaction. They value individuals dedicated to
682

self-development, effective communication, and conflict resolution.
They aim to foster a ‘medium demand’ community where residents
are interconnected and involved in each other’s lives. Currently,
EV1 is in its start-up phase, experimenting with sustainable prac-
tices.
Eco-Village 2 EV2 was founded as an alternative community on
640 acres by P4 and his 15 friends in 1978. By 1983, the population
fluctuated from around 100 to just 8, prompting the landlord to
design a subdivision to allow for legal, long-term dwellings. With
the assistance of four Permaculture designers, the community was
legally established in 1986 following local council approval. The
property includes 83 freehold residential lots and two commercial
lots, which make up 20 percent of the land, while the remaining
80 percent is held in common for habitat, forestry, and sustain-
able agriculture. This community was awarded the World Habitat
Award for its demonstration of low-impact, sustainable living. EV2
is managed by both a Body Corporate, responsible for property
administration, and a Co-Operative, which functions as a public and
social organisation. Today, EV2 is home to more than 200 residents.
3.2 Data Collection and Analysis
Fieldwork in this paper involved multiple extended stays in two
eco-villages, where the first author participated in everyday life,
including making activities, routine maintenance, and informal
social interactions. This immersive, situated engagement aligns
with the principles of design ethnography, which values close, em-
bodied observation of people’s interactions with technologies in
context. By participating in daily practices, the researcher was able
to gain insight into the tacit knowledge, values, and improvisational
problem-solving that shape the use of composting toilets.
Data were collected through a combination of semi-structured
interviews, photographs, and field notes. Interviews explored partic-
ipants’ motivations, building and maintenance practices, challenges
and adaptations, as well as their broader reflections on sustainable
living. Photographs and field notes served as tools to document
spatial configurations, material interactions, and emergent social
dynamics around the composting systems. This approach reflects
the commitment of design ethnography to understanding not just
what people say, but also what they do and how they inhabit com-
plex socio-material settings [11].
After each field engagement, the first author systematically or-
ganized and annotated the data, identifying key fragments and
recurring themes. These were discussed with the second author
within one week of each visit, allowing for iterative interpretation
and reflexive sense-making. This process enabled the development
of analytical categories grounded in the material, while also allow-
ing conceptual insights to emerge collaboratively over time.
3.3 Limitations and Positionality
We acknowledge that our focus on eco-villages means our par-
ticipants were generally predisposed towards sustainability and
alternative lifestyles, potentially influencing their perspectives on
composting toilets. The findings are specific to these remote Aus-
tralian contexts and may not directly translate to urban or differ-
ent cultural settings without adaptation. As researchers interestedin sustainable design, our own values may shape our interpreta-
tions, though we aimed for reflexivity throughout the analysis by
grounding interpretations in specific ethnographic data and ANT’s
symmetrical approach.
4 Findings
4.1 Stewardship and More-Than-Human Care
A core motivation driving the adoption of composting toilets in
both eco-villages was a commitment to environmental stewardship
and a desire to live differently from mainstream consumer culture.
This ethos shaped community governance structures and daily life.
The two founders of EV1, P1 and P2, are local Greens Party
members and also the founders of Eco Villages Australia (EVA).
EVA is a non-profit organization dedicated to providing a model to
create communities for small groups of people. EV1 is their first eco-
village, purchased and established in 2019 in remote Australia. They
have developed a community model called ’Collective Stewardship’
[15]:
"All buildings (except for those on wheels), and the
land is owned by non-profit which is based on a Com-
munity Land Trust. Those who can afford it, loan
money to EVA, for the purchase of the land and any
improvements and building. All residents rent the
spaces they require. This income covers operational
costs and paying back loans. If the land is ever sold,
the money goes back to the non-profit company after
all loans have been returned. This structure makes it
impossible for individuals to benefit from the sale of
land, which means that the land is essentially locked
away in perpetuity for environmental care." (Eco Vil-
lages Australia)
In P1 and P2’s simple living, they aim to reduce financial and
ecological costs. When they purchased the property, the house had
a flush toilet connected to the municipal sewage system. However,
they decided not to use the flush toilet and instead DIY a compost-
ing toilet. Their goal is to achieve resource recycling. P1 and P2
mentioned that traditional flush toilet systems rely heavily on water
resources and sewage treatment facilities. In contrast, composting
toilets do not require any water and use natural decomposition
processes to turn human waste into fertilizer, which is then re-
turned to the soil. Initially, they conducted extensive research on
composting toilets, from commercial bio-gas systems to various
open-source composting toilets. Ultimately, they decided to start
with the simplest option: bucket toilets. As P1 commented:
“We have started asking the question: Can the rest
of the world do this? Can the rest of the world have
flush toilets? No. Composting toilets? Yes!”
This comm reflects a conscious problematisation [ 8] of conven-
tional sanitation, reframing it as unsustainable and seeking alterna-
tives aligned with their stewardship values. The choice of a simple
DIY system also connects to their emphasis on participation and
skill-sharing. Giving people space, time, and support, P2 thought
the most exciting part of participating in making projects is sharing
knowledge. P2 commented that lack of confidence and knowledge
was a barrier for her to participate in making and fixing things. P2
683
Mediating the Human-Nature Relations by Composting Toilets C&C ’25, June 23–25, 2025, Virtual, United Kingdom
had never picked up a hammer before, and now she can fix things
on the roof and really get into it. Making is a journey for her to
learn and gain confidence. They also suggest that working with
others towards a shared vision is an essential need for humans. This
highlights the creative and empowering aspects of DIY infrastruc-
ture within the community. They think, however, our current social
systems take us further away from our needs rather than closer to
our needs. Through designing and making things together, they
attempted to manage power imbalances resulting from different
skills, capabilities, and willingness. As P2 commented:
“My ideal eco-village is rarely designed. I want to live
in a place that is evolving in some way. You know,
people sometimes ask us when will it be finished?
Well, now and never is finished. That is the answer
at every point. It’s a resident led, consensus driven
growth journey.”
This quote underscores the value placed on emergent, participa-
tory processes over fixed master plans. Similarly, P4 (the founder of
EV2) strongly agrees with the Australian Aboriginal concept of the
“past, present, and emerging” custodians of the country. He sees
custodianship as an ongoing responsibility. Prior to 1977, EV2’s land
was used for excessive grazing, and the previous tenants burned
part of the forest every year for grazing. After P4 took over the
farm, there has never been a strategic burn again. In the earliest
days of the community, P4 recalled that the care of the land was
a priority, and a policy of no spraying with hormones and no use
of artificial fertilisers was adopted. At the same time, early com-
munity members discovered that kangaroos, wallabies and other
animals could not feel safe if dogs and cats were present in the
community. Therefore, as part of their custodianship of the land,
some members found other homes for their dogs, and these policies
were adopted into the new structure of the community thereafter.
As P4 commented:
"The concept of custodianship resonates strongly with
me. Since my teen years I have rejected our cultural
concept of ownership. I have not owned anything of
significance, be it land, horses or other items that were
important in my life. In my mind I had a custodianship
of them that allowed my interaction with, access to
them and a responsibility to care for their welfare."
Here, custodianship explicitly extends to non-human actors
(land, animals), influencing community rules and shaping the actor-
network. The decision to ban dogs and cats demonstrates how
non-human interests were enrolled into the community’s structure.
In the early 1980s, P4 realised that in order for people to settle
and build long-term homes, they needed a legal entity. P4 found
four Permaculture experts and a development group to redesign
the community based on Permaculture principles, and received
council’s approval. P4 transferred the land to the newly established
Trust, and the deposit for the residential lots was used for the con-
struction of infrastructure such as roads, dams, and power supply.
After discussions with newly moved community members, EV2
established two different legal entities, the Body Corporate and
the Coop, each with different responsibilities; the Body Corporate
committee represents the landowners, and the Coop provides ser-
vices to the general community. But P4 recalled that with two legalentities, the community’s decision-making process became difficult
or even impossible. Many times, important issues are discussed
for long periods of time without reaching a decision. For years,
the Coop’s expenses exceeded its income, and the Body Corporate
needed to provide funds to keep the Coop afloat. This illustrates
the challenges of mobilisation and maintaining alignment within a
larger, more complex network involving diverse human actors and
formal governance structures.
P4 mentioned that the purpose of most people moving to EV2
is that “people come here to rediscover their connection to each
other and their connection to the land. ” “Connection to each other”
is compassion and understanding for all humans, not just between
members of the community. The “connection to the land” is not just
a connection to the soil, but a connection to all the plants, reptiles,
insects, birds and animals that live on the land. P4 emphasises that
"land" is not just EV2’s 640 acres, but our planet Earth. After more
than 40 years of development, P4 pointed out that EV2 has become
a model for self-sufficient eco-villages around the world. In the cur-
rent era of consumerism, P4 emphasises that EV2’s role is to bring
the responsibility of protecting the land into mainstream society.
EV2 needs to extend experiences and lessons learned beyond the
boundaries of the land. As P4 commented:
"I have a mantra I have used during the past two years.
It is ’creativity, spontaneity, and freedom of spirit’. I
repeated it often. Perhaps this is adding to the present
energy of change. I am aware of many individuals and
groups here in the community who are involved in
unselfish and deeply empathetic projects. Projects to
help others both within Australia and overseas. This
applies to some residents who have projects in remote
Indigenous communities, In Africa, in Cambodia and
other Asian countries. The potential exists here to
provide an example of a community that is a true
self-sustaining eco-village... Increasing numbers of
people will attend courses here and take the knowl-
edge out into mainstream society. We will employ
methods and techniques that reverse the present cli-
mate change, land degradation and species extinction
trends... Food production on the land will increase
and we will utilise modern technology such as block-
chain and crypto-currency in creative ways. We will
have self-drive electric vehicles for use around the
land that will come to our dwellings when requested
and take us to our destination."
P4’s reflections highlight the ongoing evolution of the commu-
nity’s goals, linking local practices to broader global concerns and
emphasising creativity and adaptation as key values.
4.2 Composting Toilets
Inspired by ANT, we clustered toilet-related non-human actors into
four categories (Table. 2): toilets, natural environment, information,
and space. Toilet actors include excrement collection, treatment,
and distribution components. Natural environment actors refer to
the ecological environment elements of the community, such as soil,
flora, microorganisms, topography, etc. Information actors refer to
684
C&C ’25, June 23–25, 2025, Virtual, United Kingdom Tao and Vyas
toilet-related guidance and signs, manure disposal and environment-
related information etc. Space actors refer to the environment where
the toilet is located, including bathrooms and outdoor landscapes,
etc.

4.2.1 Bucket Toilets (EV1). EV1’s composting toilet (Fig. 1) is lo-
cated in a small separate cabin next to the communal living space.
Community members started with a reclaimed solid wood televi-
sion cabinet and transformed it into a composting toilet. This act of
repurposing exemplifies a DIY, resourceful approach. The inside of
the cabinet has two separate compartments, each holding a plastic
bucket for collecting excrement. Two holes were made in the top
of the cabinet, and lids were installed to cover them after each
use to prevent odours. The middle drawers are used for storing
toilet paper and other items. A bucket of sawdust is placed next
to the seat, and after each use, a layer of sawdust is spread over
the excrement to control odours and provide the necessary carbon
source for the subsequent composting process. Here, the TV cabinet
(now toilet actor), buckets, lids, and sawdust (material actors) are
enrolled alongside human users into a functional system.
To ensure hygiene and proper function of the toilet, community
members have developed detailed usage and maintenance guide-
lines for visitors. This represents an information actor designed
to ’scrip’ user behaviour. After each use, users need to cover the
excrement with a layer of sawdust. Every morning, residents take
turns to remove the buckets, empty the excrement into the com-
posting area, and clean the buckets. This routine maintenance is
crucial for the network’s stability. The composting area uses a lay-
ered method, with the bottom layer consisting of straw to help
absorb liquids and promote decomposition. The composting pro-
cess takes about a few months, and the resulting compost is used
for gardens and bushes. This connects the toilet system directly
to the local ecosystem (soil, plants, microbes). Every Sunday, EV1
hosts Working Bees, inviting surrounding community residents
to experience their lifestyle. Community members also travel to
other communities to spread their philosophy and teach the use of
composting toilets. This represents ’mobilisation’ – extending the
network and enrolling others.
P1 also highlighted the economic and infrastructural simplic-
ity: bathrooms are the most expensive rooms because of internalplumbing and waterproofing. The infrastructure to make people
have a comfortable shower at night costs a lot. Thus, they decided
to build an outdoor shower. The perceived sacrifice they considered
is that people cannot take showers when they want to. They need
to do it when the sun is ready. Hence, they usually take showers
in the middle of the day. Because of the beautiful outdoor scenery,
they do not think it is a sacrifice. As P1 commented:
“Are we prepared to go backwards? What comforts
are we willing to give up”
This quote addresses the ’interessement’ involved in adopting
alternative infrastructures, challenging notions of comfort and
progress.
4.2.2 Urine Division Toilets (EV2 - P3’s Tiny Houses). P3 and his
partner, both musicians in their 70s, have constructed two tiny
houses and are now beginning to build a third in EV2. P3 chose to
build the tiny houses because he felt that investing in property was
more worthwhile than keeping money in the bank. He believes it
would be beneficial to create living spaces, either for his own future
use or for others. His partner intended to build two additional tiny
houses for their two daughters. Through word of mouth, people
learned about the eco-village, visited, and inquired about leasing
the tiny houses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in these
accommodations increased significantly as more people sought out
such living arrangements. P3 thinks that the pandemic prompted
people to reassess their needs. However, P3 noted that some tenants
found using the composting toilet challenging. As P3 commented:
“I did a lot of research on toilets. For me, that works
fine. Because I understand it. I helped build it. But
people somehow they messed it up. It’s too easy just
to flush it. We have to deal with our own stuff. ”
This highlights a breakdown in ’enrolment’ when users (tenants)
do not share the same understanding or commitment as the de-
signer (P3). The toilet’s ’script’ was not successfully followed by
all users, revealing the fragility of the network when key actors do
not perform their expected roles.
The composting toilet used by P3 is from Toilets for People (TFP).
This is a small-scale composting toilet with urine diversion (Fig. 2).
When users use the toilet, solid excrement and urine are collected
separately. Solid excrement falls into a rotating drum, while urine
is diverted through a pipe to another container. TFP provides a DIY
kit similar to IKEA-style flat packaging, including all the necessary
parts and allowing users to construct the outer shell themselves.
This kit acts as a ’translator’, enrolling users in a specific assembly
process. It features a rotating composting drum and a compost tray.
For 2 adults, it needs to be emptied approximately every 2 months.
The manure is collected in a covered container, accessible from
the front, while urine is collected in a container at the back. P3’s
composting toilet is equipped with a ventilation fan and is powered
by a small solar battery. These non-human actors – fan, battery,
solar panel – are crucial for managing odour and moisture. Since
over 90% of waste entering the toilet is water, the ventilation system
evaporates the moisture into the atmosphere, ensuring odourless
usage and decomposition of manure. Solid excrement mixes in the
rotating drum with other organic material (such as coconut coir or

compost.
This composting toilet was originally designed and built by P3
for personal use, not for rental purposes. However, after this tiny
house was completed, some people came to EV2 hoping to rent
it. P3 mentioned that during the rental, some people may find it
challenging to adapt to using this type of toilet. For instance, this
composting toilet is designed for sitting use. However, for those
who prefer standing while urinating, the urine diversion area is
relatively small, making it easy to make a mess in the toilet. This
illustrates a mismatch between the toilet’s inscribed ’script’ and
the diverse practices of potential users. Additionally, some tenants
may not promptly mix organic matter and clean the compost. P3
emphasises that sustainable living requires more daily maintenance.
P3 also pointed out that we also need to change our mindset; while
flush toilets may be convenient, through daily maintenance and
managing our own composting, we may discover a more meaningfulexperience. This again points to the ’interessement’ required to
stabilise the network around non-conventional practices.
During his tenure as chairman of the Body Corporate in EV2
for a year, P3 gained insights into the community dynamics. With
over 200 residents, EV2 stands out for its residents’ independence
compared to those outside the community. The demographic tilt
towards an ageing population has attracted people seeking tranquil-
lity, less concerned about organisational aspects. His vision of an
ideal eco-village revolves around fostering communal interactions.
P3 envisions clusters within the community sharing communal
spaces like a well-equipped kitchen and laundry facilities, encour-
aging residents to come together and collaborate. He believes that
a successful eco-village should strive to diminish individualistic
tendencies in favour of fostering cooperation and a sense of com-
munity among its members. P3’s reflections touch upon the tension
between individual autonomy and collective action needed to main-
tain shared infrastructure and community cohesion, a key challenge
in mobilising larger networks.

4.2.3 Desiccating Toilets (EV2 - Common Practice). The EV2 com-
munity is situated on 640 acres of land, which includes 15 various-
sized dams. To protect these water resources and local ecosystems,
the community strives to control any form of wastewater discharge.
Since there is no municipal sewage system in the community, each
household is required to manage its own wastewater. The dams’
presence strongly ’interested’ the community towards waterless
solutions. Most residents opt for desiccating toilets (dry compost-
ing toilets), a practice that has been in place for over 30 years.
This represents a long-term, stabilised network. Residents of EV2
were provided with instructions on how to design and construct
sanitation systems in the owner’s manual. This manual acts as a
key ’translator’ standardising practice. Additionally, due to abun-
dant timber resources and the hot, humid climate, most houses are
built with the elevated structure. This design not only minimises
land disturbance but also provides space underneath the house for
composting toilets.Desiccating toilets (Fig. 3) typically require a certain amount of
space for storing and processing waste, and the space under the
elevated structure perfectly meets this need. The area beneath the
elevated structure can be used for the installation and maintenance
of composting toilets, avoiding the need for excavation of land. The
space under the elevated structure helps with the ventilation of the
composting toilet, reducing odours and promoting decomposition.
Maintenance and cleaning of the composting toilet are more con-
venient under the elevated structure, allowing residents to easily
inspect and clean the compost. Sun, chimney height, and airflow
are critical non-human actors in this design.

introduce a framework of Tinkering, Linking, and Becoming to
analyse the mediative and creative roles of these DIY systems, and
finally reflect on the implications for creativity support and Sus-
tainable HCI.
5.1 ANT on Composting Toilets
In the actor-network of the eco-village, there are both human actors,
such as long-term residents and short-term visitors, and non-human
actors, such as space, infrastructure, information, and the natural
environment. The problems of each actor converge at the obliga-
tory passage point before translation occurs [ 8]. From the residents’
perspective, their problem is how to change their lifestyle to reduce
the impact on their living land (problematisation stage, driven by
stewardship values). From the perspective of the natural environ-
ment (represented by actors like soil, water, local ecosystems), the
problem is how to integrate human activities into the ecological
cycle. Both of these problems can be focused on toilets and wastemanagement, which is the obligatory passage point. Determining
the obligatory passage point can help all types of actors reach a
consensus, work together to solve problems, remove obstacles, and
promote the formation of the eco-village actor-network.
Participants believe that the composting toilet is the key to trans-
forming their lifestyle. Therefore, we use the composting toilet as
a clue for the translation process of the actor-network. The transla-
tion process usually includes four basic stages: problematisation,
interessement, enrolment, and mobilisation. In the problematisation
stage, the focal actor, the composting toilet, needs to discover the
common goal of residents and the natural environment, which is to
make human a contribution to the natural environment. Therefore,
the composting toilet needs to endow interests to both humans and
the environment: for residents, the toilet needs to provide a com-
fortable and hygienic defecation environment, reducing odour and
health hazards caused by composting; for the natural environment,
the toilet needs to reduce the pollution of untreated faeces. After
interessement (e.g. showing nutrient benefits to gardens), the actors

Figure 4: Eco-village’s Actor-Network from Toilet’s Perspective
are mobilised to take action. In the enrolment stage, human actors
need to consider the cost and maintenance of making composting
toilets, which is usually discussed by residents through participa-
tory design (as seen in EV1) or adoption of established community
standards (as in EV2). The discussion focuses on the defecation
space experience and facility maintenance, so space becomes an
actor that joins the network at this stage (e.g., the cabin in EV1,
under-house space in EV2). In the mobilisation stage, temporary
visitors or new residents need to be considered. As using compost-
ing toilets is a different experience from flush toilets for ordinary
people, information becomes an actor that joins the network at this
stage (e.g., guidelines, manuals, induction), providing guidance on
the correct use of composting toilets and attempting to align their
behaviour with the network’s requirements (as highlighted by P3’s
challenges with tenants).
Inspired by ANT, we clustered non-human actors into four cat-
egories: toilets, natural environment, information, and space. Toi-
lets transform from actors to mediators, connecting human actors
with the natural environment, information, and space as a net-
work. Space actors can be divided into indoor and outdoor: indoor
space can provide users with a safe and private toilet environment;
outdoor space can be used as a landscape to enhance the toilet
experience. Information actors can be divided into three categories:
toilet management, user guidance, and environmental information.
Toilet management actors need to monitor the toilet chamber’s
remaining capacity and the compost pile’s maturity. User guidanceactors need to respond to users’ needs and proficiency. Environmen-
tal information actors need to collect and analyse data on terrain,
weather, vegetation, etc., to provide references for compost site
selection and fertiliser distribution. Natural environment actors
can be broadly divided into four categories: microorganisms, soil,
plants, and water. Microorganism actors participate in the compost
fermentation process and return to the soil during the fertilisation
process to improve soil quality. Soil and water provide conditions
for plant growth, and the food that grows can be eaten and fed back
into this network through the digestive systems of humans and
animals. ANT helps visualise this complex web of dependencies
and translations that sustain the composting toilet system.
5.2 Mediating the Human-Nature Relations by
Composting Toilets
In this section, we analyse how composting toilets mediate human-
nature relations three interconnected processes: Tinkering, Linking,
and Becoming. These processes work together to transform waste
management from a hidden, specialised process into a visible, par-
ticipatory activity that reconnects humans with ecological cycles.
By embracing existing resources through tinkering, building rela-
tionships through linking, and designing for adaptability through
becoming, eco-village residents create alternative infrastructure
that not only manages waste but also reshapes their relationship
with the natural world.

5.2.1 Tinkering: Engaging with Existing Resources and Systems.
Composting toilet systems in the eco-villages often emerge through
’tinkering’ – a creative process of adapting and repurposing exist-
ing materials and knowledge, akin to the concept of bricolage in
Adhocism [ 28]. This contrasts with standardised, top-down infras-
tructure solutions. In EV1, the bucket toilet built from a reclaimed
TV cabinet is a prime example. This approach starts by asking
fundamental questions: What are the basic human needs (hygienic
waste disposal, odour control)? What materials are readily available
on-site or nearby (reclaimed furniture, sawdust)? How can we work
with natural processes (microbial decomposition)? This tinkering
makes the system’s workings transparent; users understand the
components (buckets, sawdust) and the process (covering waste,
emptying buckets, composting). This transparency encourages par-
ticipation, as seen with P2 gaining confidence through hands-on
involvement. This practical, situated creativity [ 27] allows ordinary
people to engage in the design and maintenance, fostering a sense
of ownership and understanding often absent with black-boxed
conventional systems. By starting with the simplest bucket toilet
design rather than implementing more complex sewage systems,
composting toilets allow users to test, learn, and iterate their designs
based on contextual conditions.
The materials used in these composting toilets reveal how tin-
kering embraces locally available resources. For example, various
covering materials are used in these composting toilets, such as
sawdust, leaves, and coconut coir. Users choose covering mate-
rials that are easy to collect, and adjust the covering amount by
observing the composting conditions. This aligns with Light et
al.’s [ 31] concept of innovation at societal margins, where resource
constraints foster creative solutions. By bringing the processes of
waste decomposition into the realm of everyday attention through
maintenance routines and composting systems, these toilets create
regenerative visibility [ 35] — the ability to see and engage with
ecological cycles that are typically hidden in modern infrastructure.
Tinkering also manifests in the way these systems are main-
tained and adjusted over time. Unlike flush toilets that immediately
remove waste from sensory experience, composting toilets extend
engagement with waste over time — from initial deposit through
maintenance routines to eventual use as garden fertiliser. Com-
posting toilets reconfigure temporal relationships with waste. Such
recognition of waste not as inert substance but as active partici-
pant in ongoing ecological processes. It also aligns with Indigenous
approaches to sustainable living highlighted by P4’s reference to
the Australian Aboriginal concept of custodianship, where humans
are seen as working within rather than controlling natural systems.
This commitment to tinkering with existing systems rather than
wholesale replacement reflects a broader ethos articulated in re-
search on posthuman design (e.g. [ 4,6,10,56]), which advocates
for working with rather than against natural processes.
5.2.2 Linking: Building Relationships Between Elements. Compost-
ing toilets link human activities with ecological cycles in ways
that conventional plumbing cannot. The composting process it-
self creates biological linkages by fostering relationships between
human waste, microorganisms, and plant growth. These linkages
are not hidden but made visible and tangible through daily mainte-
nance practices. As Haraway [ 22] suggests, humans are "companionspecies" that coexist within complex webs of relationship. Com-
posting toilets transform the affective dimension of human-waste
relations. Several participants described a profound shift in how
they perceive excrement. The initial disgust or aversion to handling
human waste gradually shifts toward appreciation of its role in
ecological cycles.
This linking extends beyond the human-waste-soil connection.
Composting toilets link residents through shared responsibilities
(e.g. emptying buckets, maintaining compost piles in EV1), foster-
ing communication and cooperation. They link individual house-
holds to community standards and knowledge networks (e.g., EV2’s
owner’s manual). They link the tangible system (toilet, compost
pile) to intangible values (stewardship, self-sufficiency, connection
to land). Designing for linking means considering how resources,
knowledge, and responsibilities can be shared to strengthen these
networks.
Social linkages are also important in these systems. Regular pub-
lic workshops and working bees are hosted in both eco-villages
to create knowledge networks that extend beyond communities’
boundaries. These gatherings help translate situated knowledge
about composting toilets into accessible practices that can be adopted
more widely. These linking practices reflect what Heitlinger et al.
[24,25] describe in their studies of grassroots food-growing com-
munities, where waste recycling and knowledge sharing build com-
munity connections. Composting toilet systems extend this concept
by making excrement, typically a taboo subject, into a provocative
topic for broader community discussion and collaboration.
5.2.3 Becoming: Designing Systems that can be Dismantled and Re-
configured. For sustainability, becoming means moving away from
designing for a finished product and towards designing for systems
and assemblages that can be taken apart and reconfigured [ 43].
The physical designs themselves embody becoming through their
modularity and reusability. For example, the composting toilets in
our study demonstrate becoming through their adaptability, their
emphasis on learning, and their capacity for disassembly and re-
configuration. The bucket toilet system can be easily disassembled,
moved, and reconfigured. Even the more complex urine-division toi-
let comes as a kit that can be adapted to different housing contexts.
This stands in stark contrast to conventional plumbing infrastruc-
ture, which typically requires professional installation and becomes
a fixed, immovable element of buildings. P2’s comment that her
"ideal eco-village is rarely designed" and that it is "a resident-led,
consensus-driven growth journey" also encapsulates the idea of
becoming. The evolution of EV2 from its early days to its current
established form, including the standardisation of desiccating toi-
lets, shows a long-term becoming process. Rather than seeking a
fixed endpoint, the concept of becoming values ongoing evolution
and adaptation.
Becoming is also evident in how these systems accommodate
learning. P3’s observation that some tenants "messed up" the com-
posting toilet because "it’s too easy just to flush" highlights the
learning curve involved in transitioning to alternative infrastruc-
ture. Rather than viewing this as a failure, the concept of becoming
treats it as part of an ongoing process of adaptation and education.
P4’s vision for the future of EV2 illustrates how becoming extends
beyond current practices to imagine new configurations: "We will
690
C&C ’25, June 23–25, 2025, Virtual, United Kingdom Tao and Vyas
employ methods and techniques that reverse the present climate
change, land degradation and species extinction trends... We will
utilise modern technology such as block-chain and crypto-currency
in creative ways." This forward-looking stance shows how eco-
villages see themselves not as static exemplars but as laboratories
for ongoing socio-technical evolution. The emphasis on becom-
ing reflects on how humans are shaped as environmental actors
[14]. Designing for becoming involves creating systems that are
adaptable to changing needs, contexts, and knowledge. It encour-
ages learning and experimentation as integral parts of the process –
users learn about decomposition, soil health, and the impact of their
actions. Ideally, these systems are also designed for disassembly
and reconfiguration, allowing materials to be reused or recycled.
By designing systems that can be reconfigured as understanding
evolves, alternative practices such as composting toilets create an
open-ended collective that embraces change, emergence, and the
potential for unexpected interactions.
5.3 DIY Infrastructure: Creativity, Community,
and Challenges
In modern life, infrastructure is often hidden under the interface
and designed and built by the government and professionals, mak-
ing it invisible to the user. In this study, we observe makers at-
tempting to break the isolation between the infrastructure and the
user interface. They rethink their needs and redesign the impact of
their behaviour on the environment. Their designs typically begin
with long-term observations of the surroundings and are iteratively
fabricated and optimised, demonstrating situated creativity and
problem-solving. Through interaction with the infrastructure, they
continually accumulate knowledge of the local environment and
achieve diversity in infrastructure forms. This aligns with calls in
HCI community to support making [ 5] and recognise the value
embedded in maintenance and repair [26].
DIY Infrastructure is a reflective activity. By getting hands-on
with the waste they generate, individuals can understand how to
be part of the ecological cycle rather than being blind to the im-
pact of their activities. In using composting toilets, makers are
not only processing human waste but also experimenting and vali-
dating different designs and technologies. This practice not only
promotes environmental awareness but also encourages innovative
solutions to environmental issues by individuals and communities.
In this way, DIY infrastructure inspires people to think about future
lifestyles and generations. Furthermore, the applications of DIY
infrastructure are not limited to personal and small-scale projects.
At the community level, collectives can participate in the decision-
making process of infrastructure and reach consensus on alternative
practices, which can enhance community cohesion and autonomy,
although challenges in consensus-building and governance exist, as
noted in EV2. In short, DIY practice proposes a new way of treating
infrastructure, which emphasises bottom-up initiative and creative
reorganisation of local resources rather than waiting for policy and
top-down changes.
However, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges and limita-
tions associated with DIY infrastructure like composting toilets. It
is important to note that the low-tech, creative designs of toiletsbased on eco-villages may not be directly transferable into mod-
ern urban settings due to space constraints, population density,
regulatory hurdles (e.g., health codes regarding waste handling),
and different cultural norms around sanitation and waste. Psycho-
logical barriers, often related to the ’yuck factor’ associated with
handling human excreta, can significantly hinder adoption. Power
structures within communities can influence whose designs are
adopted and how maintenance labour is distributed, potentially
creating inequities. Economic disparities also play a role; while
some DIY solutions are low-cost (like EV1’s bucket toilet), more
sophisticated systems or the time required for maintenance might
be prohibitive for some. The success observed in the eco-villages
in this study relies heavily on shared values, community commit-
ment, and available land – factors often absent in other contexts.
Furthermore, scaling these solutions requires navigating complex
regulatory landscapes and potentially integrating with existing (or
replacing parts of) centralised systems, posing significant political
and logistical challenges.
5.4 Implications for Creativity Support and
Sustainable HCI
The DIY infrastructure practices we observed embody transforma-
tional creativity [ 7] through their radical reconceptualisation of
waste management. Unlike incremental improvements to conven-
tional sewage sanitation systems, composting toilets fundamentally
transform the conceptual framework surrounding human waste
— from problem to resource, from linear to circular, from hidden
to visible. This transformation requires cognitive shifts that chal-
lenge deeply held cultural assumptions about cleanliness, waste,
and human relationships with bodily functions. Despite challenges
mentioned above, the principles observed offer implications for de-
sign and research in sustainable HCI, particularly concerning how
to foster creativity and more sustainable human-nature relations
through infrastructure:
(1)Conceptual reframing from ’waste as pollution’ to ’waste
as nutrient’ enables new design possibilities. Participants
consistently described how composting toilets required them
to "think differently" about waste. Such alternative concepts
combine multiple value systems that are often seen as sepa-
rate or contradictory in conventional design. Technical ef-
ficiency, ecological regeneration, aesthetic experience, and
community building are integrated rather than traded off
against each other. This hybridisation creates creative com-
munities [ 32] — groups that collectively re-imagine and re-
build their material surroundings.
(2)Instead of designing infrastructure for people, explore infras-
tructure by people. Promote transparency in infrastructure
systems, making their workings understandable and modifi-
able by end-users. For example, P1 and P2 keep the bucket
toilet as simple as possible and try to use easy approaches to
manage complexity. In this way, end-users can discuss and
redesign the community infrastructure to meet their needs
and ethos, fostering ongoing creative engagement. Neverthe-
less, building the system takes more time than purchasing
ready-made solutions. Tinkering through retrofitting and
reflection can lead to creativity and ingenuity.
691

(3)Design small, modular, and connected components that link
waste to production in the local environment. Compared to
modern flush toilets, all composting toilets presented in this
paper are relatively small. The local environment, however,
is more closely connected to them through composting. Ex-
crement can be transformed into manure to nourish the local
flora instead of being flushed away. With small components
like composting toilets, food gardens, trees, and microbes
connecting together, the network produces no waste within
its intended cycle.
(4)Explore interaction possibilities that build relationships be-
tween humans and non-humans, fostering more-than-human
care. The composting toilet facilitates engagements among
diverse non-human stakeholders. The local flora and fauna
are considered, even prioritised, when designing the com-
munity infrastructure (as seen in EV2’s policies). The cohabi-
tation and biodiversity achieved by composting also provide
positive feedback to the residents, reinforcing their relations
to the non-human world.
(5)Mobilise DIY infrastructure and ecological knowledge-sharing
networks. Even though projects in this paper are highly
contextual, responding to the local conditions, these toilets
also show the flexibility to be adapted to other scenarios.
DIY infrastructure not only serves as a possible solution
for the sustainable living but can also be used as a sense-
making method to co-create preferable futures and foster
transformational creativity [ 7]. With emerging technologies,
researchers should explore ways to mobilise traditional and
local ecological knowledge and foster grassroots innovations
while critically addressing the socio-political barriers to their
wider adoption.
6 Conclusion
As sustainability issues grow, designers and researchers need to
critically look at toilets. Instead of isolating human from nature
and making excrement a burden on the environment, it is better to
design toilets to connect human and nature, return manure to the
soil, and improve the environment. This paper presents findings
from a design ethnography in eco-villages about composting toilets
and sustainable living. Through the lens of Actor-Network Theory,
we illustrate three types of composting toilets and describe how
these toilets can mediate the relationships between humans and
non-humans from an object-centred perspective. Moving forward,
there are opportunities to extend this work by designing novel
toilets based on our composting toilet actor-network model.
