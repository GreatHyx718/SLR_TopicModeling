Abstract 
It is pivotal for patients to receive accurate health information, 
diagnoses, and timely treatments. However, in China, the signif-
cant imbalanced doctor-to-patient ratio intensifes the information 
and power asymmetries in doctor-patient relationships. Health 
information-seeking, which enables patients to collect information 
from sources beyond doctors, is a potential approach to mitigate 
these asymmetries. While HCI research predominantly focuses on 
common chronic conditions, our study focuses on specialized dis-
orders, which are often familiar to specialists but not to general 
practitioners and the public. With Hemifacial Spasm (HFS) as an 
example, we aim to understand patients’ health information and 
top-tier1 medical resource seeking journeys in China. Through in-
terviews with three neurosurgeons and 12 HFS patients from rural 
and urban areas, and applying Actor-Network Theory, we provide

1 Introduction 
In the context of patients seeking medical assistance, doctors often 
play a crucial and authoritative role [25], as they are generally
regarded as common and reliable sources of accurate information 

CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chan, et al. 
Figure 1: Study Overview. In this paper, we focus on specialized disorders, taking Hemifacial Spasm as an example to better 
understand how patients mitigate the information and power asymmetries in the doctor-patient relationship through health 
information-seeking in China. We proposed a health information-seeking network formed by four units and identifed fve 
strategies, each involving diferent units, utilized by patients to access top-tier medical resources. 
and adequate treatment options. However, in China, the doctor-to-
patient ratio is highly imbalanced2, thus accessing top-tier medical 
professionals can be challenging for many patients. Often, they can 
only consult with doctors within their reach (who may not have 
the right expertise) and have to rely on the authority and health 
information those doctors provide, without the ability to verify 
it due to limited information sources. This scenario contributes 
to the information and power asymmetries in the doctor-patient 
relationship. 
Individuals who become aware of abnormalities in their bodies 
typically seek and utilize various health information resources, such 
as healthcare systems, fellow patients, friends, family, and the inter-
net. As such, actively seeking health information is a vital approach 
to mitigate the potential information and power asymmetries in 
the doctor-patient relationship, empowering patients with knowl-
edge beyond those provided by their doctors. The use of online 
sources for health information-seeking has become prevalent, with 
patients using search engines and social media for self-diagnosis 
2China has only 1.98 medical doctors per 1,000 of the population, including generalist 
and specialist medical practitioners, falling short of the World Health Organization’s 
standard for primary healthcare needs, which is more than 2.3 health workers per 
1,000 [1]. and exploring potential treatments [27, 102]. It can lead to signif-
cant ofine impacts, afecting patients’ emotions and infuencing 
their health-related decisions [21, 36, 57, 60, 78]. 
Extensive research within the HCI communities has been dedi-
cated to understanding the practice and design of tools supporting 
health information work in the context of common chronic condi-
tions, such as diabetes, dementia, cardiovascular disease [29, 49, 70], 
which are generally well-known to the public. In contrast, stud-
ies focusing on rare diseases [68, 69, 76] and specifc disorders 
[71, 81, 88] are fewer. There is a signifcant gap in understand-
ing conditions that are familiar to specialized doctors but not to 
the general public. These conditions typically have relatively low 
prevalence, which means that even general practitioners may not 
be familiar with them. Thus, patients are often struggling to reach 
specifc departments for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we refer 
to these conditions as specialized disorders and use Hemifacial 
Spasm (HFS) as an example to better understand this challenge. 
Unlike common chronic conditions, HFS as a specialized dis-
order has a total prevalence of only 9.8 per 100,000 [77] and is 
predominantly managed within the felds of neurosurgery, leading 
to limited public exposure and access to relevant health information. 
The Odyssey Journey CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
The uncommonness of HFS, coupled with its similarities to facial 
paralysis, increases the risk of misdiagnosis and misinformation, 
making it challenging for patients to fnd adequate and satisfactory 
treatment options. This issue is particularly acute in rural areas, 
where lower health literacy levels may impede individuals’ ability 
to obtain proper health information [4]. Consequently, these factors 
exacerbate the gap between doctors’ authoritative and professional 
knowledge and patients’ limited information sources, intensifying 
the information and power asymmetries in doctor-patient relation-
ships. 
HFS patients often undergo a long journey before they can access 
medical treatments, averaging 11.4 ± 8.5 years [ 100]. Our research 
aims to understand how these patients are empowered by lever-
aging various approaches, such as actively seeking information, 
utilizing the internet, and engaging in social networking. This em-
powerment is critical in overcoming the information and power 
asymmetries that exist in doctor-patient relationships, thereby im-
proving their access to health information and medical resources, 
particularly to top-tier medical services. It is signifcant to explore 
how HFS patients navigate the needed health information, gain 
access to efective treatment options and channels leading to top-
tier medical resources, thereby our study aim to investigate the 
following research questions: 
RQ1: What are the primary sources from which HFS patients seek 
health and healthcare information? 
RQ2: What strategies do HFS patients adopt to acquire top-tier 
medical resources and services, and how do these strate-
gies empower them to mitigate the power and information 
asymmetries in the doctor-patient relationship? 
This study employs qualitative research methods to explore the 
health information and top-tier medical resource seeking journey 
of HFS patients in China. We conducted semi-structured interviews 
with three neurosurgeons and 12 HFS patients from rural (N=6) and 
urban areas (N=6) of China. During the frst round of data analysis 
using thematic analysis, we discovered that health and medical 
information seeking for HFS patients mainly relies on guanxi3 
and social interactions, especially for those from rural areas, with 
technology playing a weak role despite its great potential to assist 
patients. Therefore, we applied Actor-Network Theory (ANT) in 
our second round of data analysis, which enabled us to identify and 
comprehend the various actors involved, analyzing and discussing 
both human and non-human entities at the same level. This ap-
proach helped us uncover how these actors collaborate and interact, 
thereby forming stable and efective health information channels. 
Furthermore, we observed the various strategies employed within 
this health information-seeking network. This analytical approach 
highlights how social networks and technology can be leveraged to 
diversify and strengthen information channels, thereby providing 
patients with broader and more efective access to various treatment 
resources. 
We contribute to the HCI communities by building upon existing 
research on health information-seeking in a broader context. With 
3Guanxi refers to the complex dynamics of social networks and relationships in Chinese 
society, which are presonalized, subjectively perceived as close, and rich in resources 
[12]. HFS as a research lens, our research introduces a novel information-
seeking perspective by focusing on specialized disorders that are 
uncommon among general patients and health practitioners. This 
particular focus sheds light on the exacerbated information and 
power asymmetries in doctor-patient relationships, allowing us 
to delve deeper into the strategies that patients utilize to access 
top-tier medical resources. Our contributions include: 
1. We provided empirical evidence and employ Actor-Network 
Theory to elucidate the roles, interactions, and workfows of 
various actors within the HFS patients’ health information-
seeking network. 
2. We identifed fve strategies utilized by patients with special-
ized disorders from both urban and rural areas in China to 
access top-tier medical resources and services. We illustrated 
these strategies as subnetworks within the broader health 
information-seeking network. Additionally, we detailed the 
advantages and challenges associated with each of these 
strategies. 
3. We found that guanxi and strong ties, as parts of human 
infrastructure, plays crucial roles in the process of seeking 
top-tier medical resources in China. Additionally, the poten-
tial of technology to empower patients assists in mitgating 
the challenges and asymmetries in medical access. 
2 Background and Related Work 
2.1 Hemifacial Spasm 
Hemifacial Spasm (HFS) is a chronic neurological disorder charac-
terized by unilateral tonic and clonic contractions of facial muscles 
innervated by the facial nerve [94], often originating from the or-
bicularis oculi muscle [100]. The annual incidence rate of HFS is 
0.78 per 100,000 [6], and the total prevalence is 9.8 per 100,000, 
although this may be underestimated due to misdiagnosis and lack 
of referral from general practitioner [77]. HFS can signifcantly 
impact a patient’s quality of life, leading to social discomfort and 
awkwardness, emotional distress, and functional limitations [84]. 
HFS can be accentuated during speaking and eating, as well as 
psychological tension [2, 106]. It is important to note that attribut-
ing these symptoms to stress and anxiety can potentially lead to 
underdiagnosis of HFS. 
The treatment options for HFS include drug therapy, Botox in-
jections, acupuncture, and microvascular decompression (MVD) 
surgery. Medications, Botox injections, and acupuncture ofer lim-
ited efcacy and temporary relife, serving as low-risk palliative 
treatments [100, 103]. Among these, MVD is the only radical treat-
ment with a high success rate for addressing the underlying cause 
of HFS [74]. However, MVD carries inherent risks and potential 
complications, with approximately one-third of patients (33%±8%) 
experiencing a delayed cure in post-operation [90]. Additionally, 
early surgical intervention is preferred because long-term HFS pa-
tients tend to have signifcantly poorer postoperative outcomes 
[86]. Notably, the primary treatments employed in China are Botox 
injections and acupuncture [101]. The shared decision-making pro-
cess is crucial when choosing between surgery and non-surgery 
options [99]. This process involves healthcare providers introduc-
ing the benefts and potential harms of available treatment options 
to patients, weighing the probabilities of outcomes alongside the 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chan, et al. 
patients’ values and needs to reach a consensus on the decision [37]. 
The optimal treatment is the one that best aligns with the patient’s 
preferences, taking into account the pros and cons of each option 
[9]. Consequently, patients who have high anesthetic or surgical 
risks may reject surgery [86]. 
2.2 Doctor-Patient Relationships in Chinese 
Context 
The doctor-patient relationship is pivotal in ensuring patients re-
ceive accurate health information, diagnoses, and timely treatments. 
However, China’s situation is distinct, especially when compared to 
developed countries like the U.S., the U.K., and Japan. These high-
income countries typically have around 10 nurses and 3 doctors 
per 1000 people, while China has only about 1.3 nurses and 1.7 
doctors [82]. This shortage of healthcare professionals in China 
may be attributed to the relatively unattractive income, unlike in 
developed western countries where being a doctor is a high-income 
occupation with signifcant returns on professional education [75]. 
In China, as society progresses, people are becoming more con-
scious of their health, leading to increased demand for medical 
resources. However, this demand is met with challenges such as 
power and information asymmetries, along with unequal allocation 
of medical resources between rural and urban areas, intensifying 
the tension in doctor-patient relationships [114]. Most developing 
countries, characterized by high power distance, often place doctors 
in a dominant position during consultations [42]. Patients may feel 
it is not their place to question their health or express their feelings, 
leading to brief consultations dominated by the doctor’s decisions, 
with little room for unexpected information exchange [46]. This 
dynamic contributes to the power asymmetry in doctor-patient 
relationships, with patients hesitant to challenge the authority of 
doctors. Moreover, doctors dominate the consultation in terms of 
knowledge, skills, time, and resources, which exacerbates the knowl-
edge gap and information asymmetry [113]. Cheng and Zou [20] 
found that doctor-patient relationships could potentially change 
how doctors diagnose and treat patients, including issues such as 
over-examination, over-diagnosis, and over-treatment [112]. As a 
result, doctor-patient relationships in China tend towards paternal-
ism, with patients striving for better medical resources to receive 
an optimal medical decision about their health. 
2.3 Health Information Seeking 
Health information-seeking refers to the methods individuals use to 
acquire information related to health, illness, health promotion, and 
health risks [ 60]. This process is dynamic; as individuals encounter 
new health information, their understanding evolves, impacting 
subsequent information-seeking and decision-making [54]. Despite 
the abundance of health information, many people sufer severe 
complications or lose their lives due to a lack of knowledge about 
prevention methods. This can be attributed to insufcient proac-
tiveness, reliance on passive information acquisition, the infuence 
of personal characteristics and information sources, as well as other 
contextual factors beyond patients’ control [59]. Therefore, explor-
ing patients’ information-seeking behaviors can provide valuable 
insights into strategies for efectively conveying information, en-
hancing self-management, and preventing disorder progression. Individuals access health information through various channels, 
including healthcare systems, friends, family, and the internet. In-
creasingly, patients, caregivers, and the general population turn to 
the internet for health information [39], which can signifcantly 
infuence their beliefs and actions [8, 26]. Online platforms such as 
search engines, social media, and online communities ofer privacy, 
real-time interaction, and archived health information, facilitating 
patient knowledge and self-diagnosis. However, barriers to on-
line health information-seeking include low health literacy, limited 
information retrieval skills, unreliable information, platform cen-
sorship, and misinformation [7, 47]. Collaboration in information 
work is crucial for helping patients understand their health con-
ditions and access healthcare resources efectively. Patients often 
collaborate with medical practitioners, family, friends, and fellow 
patients [15, 53]. Health information-seeking is benefcial not only 
for acquiring knowledge but also for navigating the healthcare 
system, especially during critical circumstances such as emergency 
visits [44, 80]. 
In HCI, health information-seeking has been examined in vari-
ous populations, including teenagers, transgender individuals, and 
patients with mental health issues, chronic conditions, and rare dis-
eases [7, 30, 53, 69, 72]. Gui et al. [44] elucidated the health service 
navigation process of parents for their children in the U.S. health-
care system and their infrastructuring work for accessing healthcare 
services [43]. Design studies have also aimed at benefting Black 
older adults and fat people in their health information-seeking ef-
forts [45, 48]. Notably, MacLeod et al. [68] explored the support 
needs met or neglected by diferent sources for patients with rare 
diseases and proposed technology designs to improve information 
sharing and navigation for these patients [69]. 
2.4 Actor-Network Theory 
Actor-Network Theory (ANT), developed in the 1980s by Michel 
Callon, John Law, and Bruno Latour [62–64], is a theoretical and 
methodological approach to social theory. ANT posits that both 
human and non-human entities, regarded as actors, infuence the 
activity of a sociotechnical system [24]. It contends that no external 
social force exists outside these relationships, and phenomena do 
not exist independently. Thus, ANT focuses on "describing" rather 
than "explaining" social phenomena [61]. It challenges traditional 
methods by defning non-humans as actors equal to humans. Ini-
tially, ANT explored how knowledge growth and structure could 
be analyzed through actor interactions [65], ofering a novel per-
spective for practical application. Despite facing both embrace and 
critique, ANT remains a valuable form of inquiry in various felds, 
such as organizational analysis, informatics, and health studies 
[104]. 
ANT has been efectively utilized within HCI communities. It 
has informed studies in participatory design [28, 41], the role of 
design materials [38, 96], the development of cyberstructures [ 83], 
mobile media use in India [58], parenting practices among Latino 
immigrants [107], asymmetries in the gig economy [52], and care 
for breast cancer survivors [66]. These diverse applications demon-
strate ANT’s efectiveness in understanding the creation and main-
tenance of various sociotechnical systems. 
The Odyssey Journey CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
In ANT, non-human entities—such as objects, transportation de-
vices, and texts—are valued equally with human actors [89]. ANT 
provides a uniform framework "regardless of the unit of analysis" 
[23], promoting "analytical impartiality" in dealing with both hu-
man and non-human entities. This approach allows for an equal 
analysis of the myriad roles within the network [95]. As we explore 
the information fow and strategies in a network of individuals and 
resources navigating pathways to top-tier medical services, ANT 
enables a systematic analysis of this sociotechnical system. By bal-
ancing the importance of social networking and technology in the 
health information-seeking network, ANT helps us delve into the 
tensions and alliances between patients, doctors, social networks, 
and technology. This comprehensive actor-network analysis aids in 
understanding the strategies patients use to mitigate asymmetries 
in doctor-patient relationships and explores the connections and 
interactions between actors. 
3 Methods 
To better understand the health information-seeking experiences 
and practices among HFS patients and explore our research ques-
tions, we referred to the methodologies in Gui and Chen [43] and 
Lefkowitz [66] for conducting interviews and qualitative analysis. 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three neurosur-
geons and 12 patients in China. 
3.1 Interviews and Recruitment 
All interviews were conducted in Mandarin and audio-recorded 
with participants’ consent. The recordings were transcribed by 
the frst author, a native Mandarin speaker who conducted all the 
interviews. Participants were fully briefed on the study’s purpose 
and received monetary compensation after data collection. This 
study received approval from the university’s Institutional Review 
Board (IRB). 
Doctor-Centered Interview. Semi-structured interviews were 
initially conducted with three neurosurgeons (denoted as D1-D3). 
These neurosurgeons, with at least fve years of professional ex-
perience, work in a top-tier hospital in Beijing (a frst-tier city in 
China). The interviews were designed to gather information from 
a professional perspective and to gain an overview of the patients’ 
situations. Topics discussed included HFS patients’ general circum-
stances, their experiences within the healthcare process, and the 
potential challenges they might face, as seen from the professional 
viewpoint. All interviews were conducted remotely via audio calls 
in July 2023, lasted from 0.5 to 1 hour. 
Patient-Centered Interview. We then conducted semi-structured 
interviews with 12 individuals diagnosed with HFS from both rural 
and urban areas (denoted as P1-P12, Table 1). Among them, P1-P11 
had undergone microvascular decompression (MVD) surgery, the 
only existing radical treatment for HFS, at a top-tier hospital in 
Beijing (a frst-tier city in China). P12, despite having sufcient in-
formation and access to treatment, was hesitant about undergoing 
surgery. Participants living in cities across China were categorized 
as urban, while those in counties and countryside areas were cat-
egorized as rural. All interviews were conducted remotely using 
audio calls via mobile phones in August 2023, except for P2 and 
P3, whose interviews were conducted via text and voice messages on WeChat4 due to P2’s limited Mandarin profciency and P3’s 
Hyperacusis5. All patients own a smartphone except P8, who owns 
a basic mobile phone. 
The patient interviews aimed to understand their experiences 
and practices related to HFS. The frst part focused on how patients 
realized and recognized their condition, with questions like "When 
did you become aware the abnormalities? " and "How did you realize 
that you have Hemifacial Spasm? ". The second part examined how 
patients sought related health and healthcare information, with 
questions like "Have you tried to self-diagnose? If so, how did you 
do that? ", "What approach did you adopt to search for health and 
healthcare information, and how did you search for it?", and "How 
did you seek medical help at that time? ". During each phase, the 
frst author listened attentively without interruptions and probed 
further with questions such as, "Is there anything else you would 
like to add? ", "How did it begin? ", and "What happened before/after? " 
until the participants had nothing more to add. Each interview 
lasted between 30 minutes to 1.5 hours. 
Participants were recruited through direct contacts and snowball 
sampling. During recruitment, they were provided with comprehen-
sive details about the study’s design, duration, and compensation. 
Recognizing the sensitivity of some interview questions, we in-
formed participants that they had complete freedom to choose 
what aspects of their communication to report. However, we still 
encountered several challenges. Many patients expressed skepti-
cism about our intentions, and some were reluctant to share their 
experiences due to the traumatic nature of their illness and post-
operative complications. Additionally, some rural patients who 
could not speak Mandarin and had low literacy refused to be in-
terviewed. Others declined participation due to work-related time 
constraints. These factors contributed to initial refusals. For those 
who expressed interest, we communicated further and conducted 
interviews through WeChat. Despite our eforts, scheduling difcul-
ties led to further refusals. Although these challenges constrained 
our ability to recruit a larger number of participants, those recruited 
were diverse in terms of locations, educational levels, occupations, 
and socio-economic statuses. 
3.2 Data Collection and Analysis 
Interview data was collected from two groups: doctors and patients. 
All interviews were recorded and transcribed into text for analysis. 
The transcripts were analyzed in two rounds using thematic analy-
sis and Actor-Network Theory (ANT) as the analytical framework. 
In the frst round of thematic analysis [13], two native Mandarin-
speaking researchers familiarized themselves with the transcripts 
and developed initial analytic interests in the HFS patients’ informa-
tion sources and practices. Each researcher immersed themselves in 
the data, marking ideas related to the research questions. They inde-
pendently organized the specifc language and concepts described 
by participants into themes through descriptive and interpretive 
analysis. Descriptive analysis focused on the explicit content of 
the transcripts, addressing research questions aimed at identifying 
and categorizing the information sources and strategies adopted

for ambient noise, making phone calls intolerable [98].

by HFS patients. Interpretive analysis, on the other hand, sought 
to uncover the underlying motivations and factors infuencing pa-
tients’ practices and strategy choices, aiming to gain insights into 
their experiences and behaviors within their social contexts [32]. 
This approach provided a deeper understanding of the motivations 
behind their strategy choices and how these strategies evolved 
over time. The researchers then generated individual lists of initial 
codes. Finally, they met to compare and combine the initial code 
lists, reaching a consensus. 
ANT guided the second round of coding. ANT is an efective 
approach for understanding complex sociotechnical systems. It con-
siders how both human and non-human entities equally infuence 
situations and analyzes how these entities interact to facilitate the 
fow and development of knowledge. We adopted the actor-network 
research framework developed by Kraal et al. [55], grounded in 
Callon’s sociology of translation and incorporating terminology 
from both Callon and Latour [ 16]. This framework interprets Cal-
lon’s "moments of translation" into four steps: "interessement", 
"enrollment", "points of passage", and the "trial of strength". In the 
interessment step, actors and actants become interested in joining 
the network. During the enrollment step, the roles of these actors 
and actants are defned, assigning a specifc role to play. Subse-
quently, one or more actors may attempt to direct, control, and 
manage the other actors in the points of passage step. In the trial 
of strength step, the stability of the network is assessed by examin-
ing whether all actors adhere to their assigned roles, ensuring the 
arrangement of actors is maintained. Guided by these steps, two 
researchers identifed the actors in the health information-seeking 
network. They sorted the initial code list based on these actors and 
defned the roles of various actors in either facilitating or hindering 
patients’ access to information, as well as the circulation of health 
information among these connections. This comprehensive exami-
nation allowed us to identify the strategies HFS patients adopted 
to access top-tier medical resources and services. All codes were 
translated into English and discussed by the research team to reach 
a consensus. 4 Findings 
Through the qualitative data analysis, we identifed the key actors 
within the health information-seeking network. Furthermore, this 
network is delineated by connections that trace the pathway of 
health information-seeking, ranging from initial illness awareness 
to the pursuit of top-tier medical resources among HFS patients. 
4.1 United-Actors and their Interactions in 
Health Information-Seeking Network 
An actor-network consists of a variety of heterogeneous actors who 
come together to form a network, based on connections and interac-
tions that align with mutual interests. Our actor-network represents 
the workfow of health information disseminated through a diverse 
set of channels. We have categorized the actors within this network 
into distinct units, based on their nature and similarities. These 
units are identifed as the Familial Unit, the Community Unit, the 
Medical Unit , and the Technological Unit . 
4.1.1 The Role of the Familial Unit. In the health information-
seeking network, two members of familial unit are central actors: 
Patients themselves and Patient’s Family Members. We frst intro-
duce the roles of each actor and then describe their characteristics 
and connections between them by cases. 
The Familial Unit–Patient. The onset age of HFS patients are 
around 48.5 ± 14.1 years old [100], ranging from the middle-aged 
to older adults. Consistent with other studies [73], we found that 
some older adult patients are reluctant to use technology, often 
perceiving it as untrustworthy or unreliable. Consequently, HFS 
patients in our study have various technology acceptance. We have 
identifed three distinct roles of patients within the network dur-
ing health information-seeking practices. The frst is the Proactive 
Information-Seeking Patient , who independently gather informa-
tion from both online and ofine sources, often accessing necessary 
information on their own. Proactive patients may still receive assis-
tance from family members, but primarily in an accompanying and 
supportive role, as they are generally independent. The second role 
is the Low Technological Literacy Patient , typically older adults who 
distrust online information or lack opportunities to use technology 
due to limited external contact. They usually rely on their children

Figure 2: ANT Graphical Depiction. By incorporating Actor-Network Theory (ANT) during the data analysis process, we 
identifed the main actors and roles in the health information-seeking network. We categorized these roles into four units, as 
shown in the fgure. Additionally, we identifed fve strategies that form distinct strategic subnetworks within the broader 
health information-seeking network. The subnetwork of the intermediary strategy is depicted in the fgure, and a specifc 
example can be seen in Fig. 4. 
for health information and prefer direct medical consultations. The 
third role is the Experienced Patient , who has other chronic condi-
tions and a history of hospitalization, making them more attentive 
to their health status and aware of HFS symptoms earlier, often 
consulting healthcare professionals directly. 
The Familial Unit–Patient’s Family Members. Family mem-
bers of HFS patients, either partners or children, assume two roles 
in the health information-seeking network: Direct Agent and Com-
panion . Direct Agents typically support technology-skeptic patients, 
acting as mediators who "transform, translate, distort, and modify 
the meaning of elements they are supposed to carry" [61]. Since 
these patients do not seek health information online, their family 
members assist in gathering both online and ofine information. 
Moreover, in China, accessing healthcare providers and making 
appointments often involves using mobile phones, a task usually 
undertaken by family members of technology-skeptic patients. Con-
versely, Companions align with proactive information-seeking pa-
tients, aiding them in information search but not dominating the 
process. They provide encouragement and support throughout the 
patients’ journey against the disorder. 
P1, a 47-year-old urban patient with 8 years of HFS experi-
ence, enacted the proactive information-seeking patient. She initially learned that she had HFS while cannot fnd the cause of it through 
internet search engines and has tried various treatments, includ-
ing folk remedy: "I did as they [colleagues] told me to stick a white 
paper on my eyelid, some kind of folk remedy, but it didn’t work." 
Her husband, acting as her companion, assists in inquiring health 
information within his own social network, as well as providing 
continuous support from the early stage of illness to post-operative 
care: "My husband and my family have been helping me in various 
ways. I started taking traditional Chinese medicine because my hus-
band’s classmate is a doctor at a clinic who specializes in prescribing 
Chinese herbs." 
On the other hand, patients’ children often exhibit greater prof-
ciency with technology and may actively seek health information 
online on behalf of their parents. For instance, P8, a 70-year-old 
with 3 years of HFS experience, lives in a rural area and fts the 
role of a low technological literacy patient. She speaks primarily a 
local dialect, barely speaks Mandarin, and usually interacts only 
with her husband. P8 uses a basic mobile phone designed for older 
adults, featuring only a keyboard and screen, to regularly contact 
her daughter. 
Her daughter plays a crucial role as her direct agent. P8 does not 
know which hospital she visits; she trusts and follows wherever 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chan, et al. 
Figure 3: Key Findings Overview. Using Actor-Network Theory, we identifed four units, each including various roles within 
the health information-seeking network of Hemifacial Spasm patients. Additionally, some of these units feature internal 
interactions (as shown on the left). We also identifed fve strategies for seeking top-tier medical resources of patients with 
specialized disorders. Each strategy involves a unique combination of units and roles, as indicated by the letter written next to 
the strategy name. 
This forms distinct strategic subnetworks within the broader health information-seeking network (as shown on the right). 
her daughter takes her. Consequently, all the health information 
P8 receives is either directly from her daughter or from medical 
professionals: "I know [that I was ill], but we [my husband and I] 
hadn’t gone out [of the rural area before], so we didn’t know where to 
go or what to do. Then, my daughter took me and tried this and that, 
but nothing seemed to work. My daughter said she heard that [there 
were good treatments in Beijing], so that’s why we went to Beijing." 
P8’s reliance on her daughter for navigating the healthcare system 
highlights the signifcant role family members play in the health 
information-seeking process, especially for those less familiar with 
modern technology. 
P3, a 70-year-old urban resident with 8 years of HFS experience, 
exemplifes a patient with low technological literacy. She rarely uses 
a mobile phone and avoids online health information, preferring 
direct medical consultations. P3 believes that consulting doctors is 
the most straightforward and efective way to acquire professional 
medical advice. She views online health information as insufcient 
and superfuous, considering it limited to symptomatic guidance and often lacking completeness and accuracy. P3 articulated her 
stance clearly: 
"I go directly to the hospital when I’m ill and don’t 
search online. I believe consulting a doctor is more di-
rect and helpful. When you’re ill, you need to see a 
doctor. The doctor will tell you how to treat it. Online 
information might give you some idea about symptoms, 
but it’s often incomplete and unreliable." 
Her daughter, a physician at a reputable hospital, enacted the role 
of a direct agent, taking responsibility for managing her mother’s 
health conditions and seeking medical advice on her behalf. All 
the health information P3 received was either directly from her 
daughter or other medical professionals. Eventually, it was her 
daughter who introduced her to a leading resource for HFS surgery 
within the top-tier medical service and persuaded her to undergo 
the surgery: "My daughter came across some information suggesting 
The Odyssey Journey CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
that neurosurgery could be a treatment option. She got this informa-
tion from the hospital [where my surgery was performed], as she is 
also a doctor there, so she is quite familiar with hospitals." 
Experienced patients are individuals who have already been di-
agnosed with other health conditions, leading them to be more 
attentive to any changes in their health status. P11, a 63-year-old 
patient living in an urban area, has been living with HFS for 15 
years. Prior to her HFS diagnosis, she was diagnosed with several 
other disorders. As a result, she meticulously records her health 
conditions, taking daily notes to better understand her body: 
"After being diagnosed with immune rheumatism, my 
hospital discharge report revealed that I have rheuma-
toid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and Sjögren’s syn-
drome. Consequently, I started keeping detailed records. 
I jot down notes about my daily medication, any bod-
ily changes, and symptoms I experience. When the eye 
twitching, characteristic of HFS, began, I included that 
in my documentation as well." 
Owing to her diligent record-keeping, she has been able to track 
her HFS symptoms accurately. This practice aids her in seeking 
consistent treatment for HFS at the hospital she regularly visits. 
4.1.2 The Role of the Community Unit. Online health infor-
mation is directly accessible to patients, while ofine health in-
formation usually requires social networking, either accidental or 
intentional. We categorize these as the community unit in real life. 
Patients accessing ofine health information outside the medical 
unit typically engage with two types of actors: those from their 
Core Social Circle and those from the Peripheral Social Circle [67]. 
The Community Unit–Core Social Circle. The core social cir-
cle consists of individuals with whom patients have direct contact, 
including relatives, friends, colleagues, and neighbors. The core 
social circle plays a crucial role in assisting patients in obtaining 
health information. Members of this circle are often aware of the 
patients’ situations and may contribute more actively to the pa-
tients’ health conditions. Within the core social circle, we identifed 
two key roles: the First-hand Informant , who provides patients with 
relevant and critical information about HFS, aiding their access to 
top-tier medical resources, and the Second-hand informant , trans-
ferring essential messages and information from others to HFS 
patients. 
The Community Unit–Peripheral Social Circle. Beyond the 
core social circle, the peripheral social circle is also a signifcant 
source of health information. While this circle may not be the pri-
mary source of information for patients, and the connections within 
it are typically weaker than those in the core social circle, there are 
instances where patients have encountered or indirectly obtained 
valuable health information from individuals in this peripheral net-
work. This includes friends of friends, family members of colleagues, 
and fellow patients met by chance in real life. The roles within this 
circle are the Intermediary , who provides signifcant information 
indirectly, and the Passerby , who may not ofer particularly useful 
information, such as fellow patients met in random places. 
P4 emphasized the trustworthiness of health information ob-
tained from friends, underscoring the importance of personal con-
nections in the health information-seeking process. P7 shared her 
experience, highlighting her confdence in health information re-
ceived from the frst-hand informant. She recounted a story about 
her relatives, which led to her mistrust of local hospitals: 
"I don’t trust local hospitals because of what happened to 
my relative. He had a minor surgery that failed, despite 
the hospital claiming it was simple and he would be 
discharged in a few days. After that incident, I chose a 
big hospital in Beijing. Everyone advised against small 
hospitals for such procedures." 
On the other hand, P5 acknowledged the infuence of colleagues 
on her treatment choices, despite having reservations: "I can’t even 
swallow a drop of traditional Chinese medicine, but some of my col-
leagues are strong proponents of it, so I’ve tried it before, infuenced 
by their belief". These colleagues, acting as the frst-hand infor-
mants, provided health information that infuenced her decisions. 
P9 discussed how his relative’s experience with HFS, who had taken 
medication without efective results, afected his own approach to 
treatment, ultimately leading him to forgo drug therapy. 
In a diferent context, P1 detailed how well-informed her friends 
were about her illness: "Exactly, they notice when something is wrong 
because we often meet, and they’re all aware of my condition. They 
know how long I’ve been dealing with this illness. " In one instance, a 
friend discovered a similar case in the husband of another friend, 
providing P1 with invaluable information. Here, P1’s friend acted 
as a second-hand informant, helping P1 acquire critical health in-
formation, while the husband of her friend’s acquaintance served 
as an intermediary, ofering crucial insights indirectly. 
This circumstance is more common among rural patients, who 
often lack direct access to quality medical resources and rely heavily 
on word-of-mouth channels. They frequently hear about similar ex-
periences from neighbors or through social connections. D2 noted 
that information tends to spread quickly in rural communities: 
"When rural patients from smaller communities return with infor-
mation, it tends to spread within about ten days. Once they return to 
their local area, word spreads, and those with similar conditions come 
forward". 
P1 shared an encounter with a passerby while waiting at a bus 
stop. They had a brief conversation during which the lady revealed 
that she was convinced that all treatments, including surgery, were 
inefective for HFS: 
"Once, I met a nearly 70-year-old lady at the bus stop 
and immediately recognized she had the same condition 
as me. I asked her, ‘Auntie, do you have Hemifacial 
Spasm?’ She was surprised and asked how I knew. I 
explained that I have the same condition and wouldn’t 
have asked otherwise, as it might have seemed impolite. 
She confrmed she did and mentioned she believed it 
was incurable. I told her that surgery could help, but 
she was skeptical. At that time, I didn’t try to persuade 
her further, especially since I hadn’t undergone surgery 
myself. If I met her now, I might tell her that surgery 
could treat it, as I was also confused about it back then. " 
4.1.3 The Role of the Medical Unit. Key actors in the medical 
unit, who signifcantly infuence patients’ pathways in seeking 

CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chan, et al. 
medical information and making treatment decisions, include Spe-
cialists (e.g., neurosurgeons, neurologists, and ophthalmologists), 
Non-Specialized Doctors (e.g., general practitioners and traditional 
Chinese medicine doctors), and Unlicensed Medical Practitioners . 
We identifed three roles they enacted in providing health informa-
tion based on patients’ conditions: Accurate Information Provider, 
Information-Scant Provider, and Misleading Information Provider. 
The Medical Unit–Accurate Information Provider. Neurosur-
geons enacted the role of Accurate Information Providers, equipped 
with proper and formal medical training and extensive knowledge 
of HFS. They specialize in MVD surgery, aimed at providing a 
complete cure for HFS. When patients consult them, they can of-
fer precise information about HFS and inform the fact that MVD 
surgery is the only radical cure available. Patients under their care 
receive an adequate amount of information about HFS and can 
access treatment or recommended resources directly from them. 
These neurosurgeons are generally responsible for diagnosing HFS, 
conducting ward inspections during hospitalization, communicat-
ing pre-operative risks, performing the surgery, and conducting 
follow-up visits as necessary. 
The Medical Unit–Information-Scant Provider. Ophthalmol-
ogists, neurologists, and most general practitioners and traditional 
Chinese medicine doctors are often the role of information-scant 
provider in our network. This is because they typically cannot pro-
vide patients with comprehensive information about HFS. Some of 
them may only ofer limited messages or treatment options for HFS 
patients following checkup and inspection, leading us to categorize 
them under the role of information-scant provider. 
Many HFS patients initially struggle to identify the correct clin-
ical department for their specifc health issues without proper 
guidance. This confusion often leads them to inappropriate de-
partments, such as Ophthalmology, under the mistaken belief that 
eyelid spasms are primarily an eye-related problem. Ophthalmol-
ogists, not being specialists in HFS, can only provide limited and 
often unhelpful information post-examination, as HFS is not an 
eye disorder. For example, P6 initially believed his eyelid spasms 
were eye-related and repeatedly consulted ophthalmologists. It was 
only after learning about HFS from a friend that he realized the 
issue was not directly related to his eyes. Similarly, P5 and P11, who 
experienced impaired vision, sought help from ophthalmologists 
but were left without a clear understanding of their condition de-
spite being told their eyes were in good condition: "It [HFS] doesn’t 
afect your vision. It twitches, but you can still see things around you. 
However, over time, I felt that my feld of vision became narrower. I 
even went to see an ophthalmologist and was told there was nothing 
wrong." (P5) 
D3 emphasized that unless a specialist is involved, other doctors 
might not recognize the disorder. Although neurologists are edu-
cated about HFS, they generally recommend medication and Botox 
treatments, which are not fully curative and lack long-term ef-
cacy. They often advise patients to opt for conservative treatments, 
leaving patients without the comprehensive information they seek. 
D2 explained that non-specialized doctors, such as general practi-
tioners and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, are usually 
the frst medical providers HFS patients consult when unaware 
of their condition. However, they often suggest limited treatment 
options like medication, Chinese herbal remedies, acupuncture, and moxibustion. These treatments are not considered efective 
cures for HFS, and the lack of information about the more defnitive 
MVD surgery can lead patients to have a constrained mindset when 
making treatment decisions: 
"For example, when a patient visits a township clinic, 
they might not know the appropriate treatment for HFS. 
Local primary care doctors might either not know about 
the illness at all or be quite unfamiliar with it. Some 
might believe Botox is efective, and traditional Chinese 
medicine practitioners might recommend acupuncture, 
but they may not realize that surgery is the fundamental 
cure. Without proper information dissemination, doctors 
may remain unaware of the illness and its efective 
treatment." (D2) 
The Medical Unit–Misleading Information Provider. Although 
some non-specialized doctors can identify and diagnose HFS, it is 
not a commonly encountered chronic condition for them. As a 
result, they may lack the necessary knowledge to accurately di-
agnose HFS, leading to a risk of misdiagnosis and the provision 
of inefective treatment options. This can misguide patients with 
incorrect directions and misinformation, categorizing these doctors 
as misleading information providers. 
While consulting doctors is the most direct method for seek-
ing medical advice, some patients encounter obstacles in accessing 
appropriate medical services. For HFS patients in rural areas, unli-
censed medical practitioners often become an alternative option. 
These practitioners, without proper medical licensing, typically 
rely on empirical or practical experiences, claiming their knowl-
edge is inherited from ancestral masters. Their treatments usually 
include methods like massage and acupuncture. However, rural 
doctors may lack the necessary expertise in conditions like HFS, 
often misdiagnosing it as facial paralysis due to its similar facial 
manifestations. P4, residing in a rural area, explained: "Rural doctors 
often treat it [HFS] as facial paralysis because it’s more common in our 
area. They are not familiar with Hemifacial Spasm". D3 elaborated 
that the most signifcant challenge for rural patients is their limited 
access to health information about their condition: 
"The biggest challenge they [rural patients] face is that 
they may not know what the illness is when they frst get 
it, and some people don’t even realize that this [surgery] 
is the way to cure it until more than ten years after 
getting the disorder. I think the inability to access infor-
mation and get timely information is one of the biggest 
challenges." 
There are cases of patients turning to barefoot doctors6 for treat-
ment. These practitioners commonly misdiagnose HFS as facial 
paralysis, a more frequent condition in rural areas. For example, 
P1 consulted several unlicensed healthcare practitioners, including 
barefoot doctors, who all incorrectly diagnosed her condition as 
facial paralysis. Despite undergoing their treatments for some time, 
her condition showed no improvement. She pursued numerous 
such treatments, driven by a sense of optimism and willingness to 
spend money on the chance of fnding a cure. She described these 
practitioners as follows: "He [the unlicensed healthcare practitioner] 
6Barefoot doctors were unlicensed healthcare practitioners who received basic medical 
training and worked in rural villages in China. 
The Odyssey Journey CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
is Taiwanese, possibly a descendant of some master. In his establish-
ment, there are group photos and other items displayed prominently 
at the front, showcasing his authority. There are many pictures of 
him supposedly curing hunchbacks, and he has received numerous 
banners for these alleged successes." 
4.1.4 The Role of the Technology. Technology forms our fourth 
category of actor, serving as an approach for patients to access 
efective health information online and to locate their ultimate 
medical resources. This category includes Digital Devices that fa-
cilitate information distribution and transfer (e.g., mobile phones 
and televisions), as well as the Software and Online Services these 
devices encompass (e.g., social media, search engines, digital con-
tent featuring videos, pictures, or text). While these technologies 
are commonplace for many people, it is important to note that 
the demographic of HFS patients spans from middle-aged to older 
adults, and not all of them are adept at using smartphones for 
information-seeking [109]. Consequently, we characterize these 
technologies as playing two distinct roles based on how patients 
acquire information: either as an Active Information Channel or a 
Passive Information Channel. 
The Technological Unit–Active Information Channel. The 
Internet has become an essential tool for patients seeking health in-
formation, ofering both convenience and efciency. Prior research 
indicates that patients prefer to seek and share health information 
online using search engines and social media [34, 35, 85]. These 
platforms are considered active channels where patients can proac-
tively fnd health information. Search engines and social media are 
the primary channels highlighted in our study. Patients can input 
keywords into a search engine, yielding a large amount of available 
information. In China, Baidu is the predominant search engine, 
while P9 is the exception one claimed that he had only searched 
on WeChat as it was his most frequently used apps. These plat-
forms serve various purposes, particularly during the awareness 
of illness stage for self-diagnosis and understanding the causes of 
their conditions, and later during the treatment decision-making 
stage to explore potential treatments and collect information about 
surgeries, healthcare professionals, and hospitals. 
Social media platforms, like Tieba and Xiaohongshu, ofer fo-
rums for individuals with similar health conditions to connect and 
share experiences. P10, for instance, sought detailed information 
about surgical procedures on Xiaohongshu. Videos, especially on 
platforms like Douyin, provide animated demonstrations that help 
patients understand surgical procedures. However, this approach 
typically requires some prior knowledge before actively engaging 
in online searches. Moreover, online information often lacks unique-
ness and personalization, leading most patients to combine ofine 
learning with online information to make informed decisions. 
The Technological Unit–Passive Information Channel. We 
categorize digital content that users encountered by chance or 
system recommendation as a passive information channel. This 
often includes content that is not actively sought out but may 
contain misleading information. For example, P4 came across a 
video on Douyin recommending a hospital in Shandong for HFS 
surgery. However, he later consulted with his relatives in Shandong, 
then he discovered which might be unreliable and even a fraud, 
as his relatives had never heard about the hospital before: "I saw 
on Douyin that there is a hospital in Shandong specializing in HFS 
surgeries. I look into it and contacted a relative there, but they had 
never heard of such a hospital and had no information about it." 
Additionally, some patients have gained awareness of their con-
dition through health programs on television. For instance, D2 
mentioned that patients have discovered nationally renowned ex-
perts through TV program: "Our director Dr. Liu is a top expert in 
this surgery nationwide. Back in the early 2000s, he appeared on the 
7CCTV health programs ’Health Road’ [to promote HFS diagnosis and 
treatment]." However, this method of information acquisition has 
become less common in recent years. 
4.2 Top-Tier Medical Resource Network 
Strategies 
From the analysis of the connections and interactions among actors 
in our health information-seeking network, we observed fve dis-
tinct health information-seeking strategies that ultimately facilitate 
access to top-tier medical resources. These strategies are named 
(see Table 2) based on the concepts illustrated in ANT. They include 
the Collaborative Inquiry Strategy, the Intermediary Strategy, the 
Self-Directed Inquiry Strategy, the Observational Strategy, and the 
Utilization of Non-Human Strategy. Each of these involves a unique 
combination of units and roles, thereby forming distinct strate-
gic subnetworks within the broader health information-seeking 
network. 
4.2.1 Network: Collaborative Inquiry Strategy. The collaborative 
inquiry strategy involves the familial unit directly networking with 
top-tier medical resources, allowing for efective and direct access. 
This strategy typically involves either frst-hand informants from 
the community unit or the medical unit. Participants can obtain 
necessary information and establish direct connections with doctors 
through online channels (e.g., video calls, audio calls, text messages) 
and ofine meetings. This approach facilitates fast and accurate 
information exchange, enabling immediate responses, making it a 
rapid and reliable method. 
In the familial unit, there may be direct connections with in-
dividuals who have recovered from HFS. These individuals, often 
in good post-operative recovery, provide trustworthy frst-hand 
information. For instance, P12, a 50-year-old proactive information-
seeking patient with four years of HFS experience and currently 
considering MVD surgery, gained insights from a friend who un-
derwent successful surgery. This friend also introduced medical 
resources to P6, P12’s colleague, who similarly had a successful 
surgery. P12 believes that resources recommended by familiar, re-
covered individuals are reliable and has been closely monitoring 
P6’s post-operative recovery, which he fnds highly informative. 
Additionally, the familial unit may have direct connections with 
medical professionals. Patients themselves or their family members 
might be doctors, or they may have doctors within their core social 
circle. For example, P3 is a 70-year-old patient living in Beijing (i.e. 
frst-tier city) with her daughter, benefts from this network. Her 
daughter, a doctor in a top-tier hospital and acting as a direct agent, 
leverages her professional network to access medical resources for 
P3.

4.2.2 Network: Intermediary Strategy. The intermediary strategy 
comes into play when direct, efective networking isn’t available. 
In such cases, the familial unit relies on inquiring within their 
social network, where information and resources often arrive indi-
rectly through intermediaries. This information typically spreads 
via word-of-mouth and daily conversations, involving the second-
hand informant and intermediary within the community unit. Pa-
tients mostly gather information from experienced and recovered 
patients, introduced by their core social circle. 
This indirect approach can be time-consuming, especially since 
HFS is relatively uncommon in the general population. It is often 
a lengthy process before patients encounter accurate resources 
about their condition. This delay is more pronounced for patients 
in rural areas. D2 highlights the struggles stemming from this delay: 
"Without proper dissemination of health information, patients might 
remain oblivious to their condition. Some have sufered for over ten, 
even twenty years, before seeking appropriate help. This prolonged 
ignorance can be quite distressing. Many resort to temporary solutions 
like Botox injections to alleviate symptoms, often repeatedly". 
Both P1 and P7 discovered top-tier medical resources through 
conversations within their social network. P1 recounts a friend’s 
awareness of her HFS and their subsequent inquiry about medical 
resources: 
"It was quite a coincidence that a friend brought it up 
casually. Many of my friends know about my condi-
tion and often ask how I’m doing. She had just met a 
friend whose husband had undergone the surgery. So, 
she called me, asking about my condition, and I said it 
was still the same. Then she mentioned that her friend’s 
husband had the surgery about eight years ago and has 
recovered very well, with no recurrence of the disease 
at all." Similarly, P7 learned about medical resources at a class reunion. 
There, she met a classmate whose brother is a doctor. She shared a 
video of her facial symptoms with him for a diagnosis and received 
contact information for the needed medical resources afterwards. 
4.2.3 Network: Self-Directed Inquiry Strategy. The self-directed in-
quiry strategy predominantly involves experienced patients and the 
medical unit. Patients with a history of illnesses tend to be more 
attentive to their health conditions. Due to their proximity to health-
care providers, they often have regular follow-up visits or maintain 
contact with doctors who have previously treated them success-
fully. This access allows them to directly reach out to authoritative 
and trustworthy doctors for personalized and professional medical 
advice. 
P11, diagnosed with several chronic immune system-related 
conditions, has extensive experience consulting various doctors and 
is familiar with the authority of diferent hospitals. She regularly 
has follow-up visits with specialists. When she noticed her HFS 
symptoms, which were diferent from her usual conditions, she 
knew exactly which trusted doctors to approach for medical advice. 
One of these doctors directly connected her with the appropriate 
medical resources. She explains her choice: 
"I chose this hospital for my immune disease because 
I’ve always trusted it, and the doctor there understands 
my condition. This doctor referred me to Dr. Liu. I had 
my child look him up on Baidu, and it turns out he is 
quite renowned nationwide for performing this type of 
surgery, with a high success rate. That’s why I trust him 
and have chosen to undergo the surgery at this hospital. " 
4.2.4 Network: Utilization of Non-Human Strategy. Using search en-
gines, browsing social media, and engaging in online communities 
are common information-seeking methods today. Most participants

medical resources. In the fgure, we depict her subnetwork while employing this strategy to illustrate how various actors in 
diferent units play their roles to support her journey. 
generally searched for key symptoms of HFS they experienced 
to identify potential issues. After learning the name of HFS, they 
may attempt to search further for potential treatments. These ap-
proaches are convenient but often present challenges in discerning 
the accuracy of the information due to the vast amount available. 
As a result, the problem of misinformation persists, and our par-
ticipants rely on social connections and Guanxi to further validate 
online information. 
Moreover, searching for conditions like HFS, which are not com-
mon chronic conditions, the efective information online is limited, 
and requires a certain degree of digital literacy and prerequisite 
knowledge. Even with access to professional knowledge, it can be 
difcult for patients to comprehend such material. Therefore, most 
patients use this strategy to enhance and confrm their understand-
ing of health information as an assistive strategy. However, it is 
hard to fully rely on online information for seeking top-tier medical 
resources for HFS. This strategy usually encompasses the active 
information channels within the technology and familial unit . 
P6 discovered his disorder through a colleague who had experi-
enced the same issue but had recovered following MVD surgery. 
He acquired medical information from this colleague and then veri-
fed it online to understand the disorder and treatment options in 
more detail. This additional research helped him decide to undergo 
the surgery. Similarly, P2 claimed, "After searching [online], I just thought that I should quickly get the surgery done and not delay it any 
longer. ". On the other hand, P5 found the top-tier hospital through 
online information provided by her sister’s child: "My sister’s kid 
did all the research. They looked up which hospital in Beijing is the 
most authoritative for this condition, and then booked an appointment 
with that professor for me.". 
4.2.5 Network: Observational Strategy. The Observational Strategy 
involves the familial unit receiving information passively or acci-
dentally, often through visual media such as television and social 
media platforms. This strategy includes the passive information 
channel within the technology unit. While encountering this type of 
information requires minimal efort, it also depends on chance, and 
there is a risk of encountering misinformation and disinformation. 
For instance, P4 stumbled upon a video recommending a hospital 
for HFS surgery, only to discover later that the hospital was not 
formal and possibly one of the Putian Hospitals8. 
P5, a 54-year-old patient who has been living with HFS for 11 
years, has a very close relationship and strong connection with 
her elder cousin sister. Whenever P5 feels unwell, she turns to her 
sister, who provides not only emotional support but also practi-
cal help, such as assisting in obtaining medications. Her sister, a

keen follower of health-related TV programs, diligently takes notes 
while watching: "My parents passed away quite early, and it was my 
sister who took care of me. She loves watching programs on CCTV, 
and she’s very attentive. After watching, she remembers cases, espe-
cially common ones like gynecological issues. She takes notes on what 
medicines to take and what remedies to try. So, whenever I feel unwell, 
I just give her a call". On one occasion, her sister urged P5 to watch 
a particular program that was discussing symptoms remarkably 
similar to those P5 was experiencing. It was this program that led 
P5 to realize that she had been exhibiting symptoms of HFS. 
5 Discussion 
In summary, for RQ1, we described HFS patients’ health information-
seeking network, involving four major units with various combi -
nations of actors and roles as their primary health and healthcare 
information sources. For RQ2, we identifed fve strategies HFS 
patients use to acquire top-tier medical resources, analyzing the 
pros and cons and the involved actors in each strategy to illustrate 
the workfows within the network. In this section, we discussed the 
similarities and diferences in primary health information sources 
between specialized disorders and other conditions. We highlighted 
the signifcance of human infrastructuring in empowering patients 
access top-tier medical resources and emphasized the potential of 
the technological unit to help patients overcome challenges and 
adopt various strategies. 
5.1 Navigating Health Information: Patients’ 
Sources 
Most research on HFS focuses on its clinical, medical, and neu-
rosurgical aspects [2, 3, 17, 86, 93], often neglecting the patients’ 
perspectives. Patients with specialized disorders, part of a marginal-
ized group, have unique challenges and needs that are underrepre-
sented. Our pioneering qualitative study highlights the voices of pa-
tients with specialized disorder, revealing their health information-
seeking behaviors. We identifed four main sources: familial , med-
ical, community , and technological units, each ofering varying 
quality of information. This framework aligns with Wilcox et al. 
[105] ’s fndings on the infrastructural forms of transgender and 
non-binary peoples’ care, assembled by informal social ecologies, 
formalized knowledge sources, and self-refective media, refecting 
similarities with our identifed units in a similarly marginalized 
population. 
In the familial unit, patients and their family members often func-
tion as a cohesive entity in managing health information. Proactive 
information-seeking patients engage with family members in com-
panion roles, while those with low technological literacy, such as 
older adults in rural areas, rely heavily on family members as direct 
agents for fnding medical resources. Song et al. [91] observed that 
older adults in rural China depend on proxy health information 
seeking due to educational and technological limitations. Similarly, 
our fndings reveal that patients struggle to fnd efective online 
information due to its repetitive nature, leading to frustration. This 
mirrors the experiences of individuals with rare diseases, who feel 
neglected by online and professional medical advice [68]. Cutilli [25] identifed various information sources like TV, radio, newspa-
pers, magazines, the internet, and personal networks that supple-
ment healthcare professional advice. Our study expands on this by 
showing that patients use online resources and social networks for 
confrmation and validation. Using ANT, we illustrated the dynamic 
interplay among these sources, highlighting how patients employ 
diverse strategies to achieve their health-related goals. 
Intermediaries play an important role in reducing information 
asymmetry of facts and perceptions [110]. In HCI, intermediaries 
are proxy users who bridge the gap between computers and users 
lacking technological skills or resources, enabling technology usage 
[51, 87]. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in low-income 
countries due to economic and cultural factors [79]. In our fndings, 
direct agents within the familial unit and intermediaries within the 
community unit are signifcant sources for improving health infor-
mation access. They act more as information intermediaries (i.e., 
infomediaries) rather than intermediaries generally referred to in 
HCI. Parikh and Ghosh [79] proposed the concept of proxy primary 
and secondary users when designing for intermediated interaction 
in developing countries, categorizing scenarios into cooperative, 
dominated, intermediated, and indirect. However, our network is 
more complex, involving various human and non-human entities. 
Intermediaries can be constitued by multiple entities, including 
non-human entities within technological unit [108]. Passive infor-
mation channels, such as televisions, function as infomediaries by 
providing random information to patients, while active informa-
tion channels can mediate health information or connect patients 
with health providers. For example, patients can access health in-
formation through human intermediaries by utilizing technological 
intermediaries, thereby reducing information asymmetry. For hu-
man intermediaries, connections are often facilitated through social 
networking and guanxi, which we will discuss in Section 5.2. 
5.2 Accessing Top-Tier Medical Resources: Guanxi and Strong Ties as the Key 
Specialized disorders require patients to engage in infrastructur-
ing work due to the limited resources and technologies available. 
Our fndings highlight the crucial role of human infrastructures in 
patient health information-seeking practices. Due to the uncom-
monness of specialized disorders, technological approaches are less 
efective, and patients often establish communities through social 
networks instead. This is particularly evident in the Chinese context, 
where we observed that most strategies adopted by patients involve 
social networking and a heavy reliance on guanxi to access top-tier 
medical resources. In Chinese society, guanxi is a unique cultural 
element that difers from Western norms. It represents personalized, 
subjectively close, and resourceful connections between individuals 
[12]. The establishment and maintenance of guanxi, typically based 
on trust and resource exchanges, are essential for acquiring infor-
mation and reducing uncertainty [33]. Through guanxi, patients 
can access scarce information and resources that might otherwise 
be unavailable [97]. This is akin to the increasing signifcance of 
guanxi in job acquisition in China, which rose from 46% in 1978 to 
80% in 2009 [11], with strong ties being particularly important [10]. 
Social networks play a crucial role in healthcare access for both 
urban and rural populations [5]. In China, strong ties are more 
The Odyssey Journey CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
signifcant, and patients trust their familial units for reliable in-
formation and resources. This contrasts with Western societies, 
where Chen et al. [18] found that Chinese individuals rely more 
on strong ties for job acquisition and promotion, while Western 
research highlights the advantages of weak ties. A typical exam-
ple from our study is P3, who leveraged a collaborative inquiry 
strategy. Her daughter is a doctor in a big city and can quickly 
connect to medical guanxi and access high-quality medical infor-
mation and resources. This aligns with Ying-He et al. [111] , who 
reported that accessing healthcare services through guanxi is a 
common phenomenon. Moreover, medical guanxi allows patients 
to obtain high-quality care and services [112]. Moreover, we found 
that rural patients are more likely to use word-of-mouth strategies 
due to fewer opportunities to connect directly with quality medical 
resources and lower technological literacy. Thus, they rely more 
on personal connections, such as close friends, or building new 
connections through intermediaries. 
Although strong ties can signifcantly help patients connect to 
quality medical services, patients can still be misdiagnosed and 
mistreated if they urgently need treatment yet have not found ef-
fective connections. Generally, patients regard medical resources in 
frst-tier cities as more reliable and secure, while distrusting rural 
health systems due to perceived lower quality of medical facilities, 
services, and doctors’ experience. However, in urgent situations, pa-
tients may turn to doctors they do not fully trust, such as unlicensed 
healthcare practitioners, often accessed through recommendations 
from strong ties, as strong ties provide trust and comfort during un-
certainty [56]. Therefore, strong ties are crucial in patients’ health 
information-seeking and medical choices, increasing patients’ con-
fdence in the rural health system. However, this reliance on strong 
ties poses challenges to implementing technologies, which we will 
mention again in Section 5.3. 
5.3 Empowering Through Technology: 
Mitigating Challenges in Medical Access 
Based on our fndings, we identifed several challenges faced by 
patients in seeking medical resources, highlighting the potential of 
technology to empower them in addressing these issues. Firstly, pa-
tients who exhibited low health literacy and technological literacy 
face tough challenges due to disparities in education, geographic iso-
lation, and transportation difculties. Especially for rural patients 
who often possess distinct identities and cultural perspectives com-
pared to urban patients [54]. The lack of healthcare professionals 
in rural areas can leave these patients feeling powerless in the ’re-
ferral games’ between rural and urban providers [14]. For example, 
both P3 and P8 are low technological patients who rely on their 
daughters as direct agents. P3, from an urban area, has direct access 
to top-tier medical services through her daughters. In contrast, P8, 
from a rural area, and her daughters have struggled to fnd accurate 
diagnosis and treatment. Secondly, patients can be easily misdi-
agnosed and seek help from unlicensed providers as discussed in 
Section 5.2. This situation exemplifes the Chinese adage, "a desper-
ate patient will seek help from any doctor". In such scenarios, the 
importance of a doctor’s credentials lessens, and patients may over-
look qualifcations due to the urgency for treatment, worsening the 
asymmetries in doctor-patient relationships. Patients prefer familiar and reliable sources in urgent situations, such as health information 
from strong ties, believing that technologies may not provide per-
sonalized and accurate information. For example, P3 thinks online 
information only provides symptom introductions and is not accu-
rate enough, leading to reluctance in using online tools. Thirdly, 
we observed that patients primarily use technology to enhance 
and validate their understanding of health information. While non-
human strategies can somewhat bridge the gaps and asymmetries in 
doctor-patient relationships—particularly benefting rural patients 
without stringent requirements—these approaches can also lead 
to misinformation and require prior knowledge. Furthermore, due 
to the uncommon nature of specialized disorders, the limited and 
repetitive information available online complicates the access to 
high-quality information. 
In fact, the technological unit holds powerful potential to miti-
gate these challenges. Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) bridges information gaps and addresses power asymmetries 
by providing previously unavailable information. Without ICT, pa-
tients often had to rely solely on referrals from local doctors or seek 
urban doctors without any prior information and assistance. ICT 
facilitates collaboration between rural and urban doctors, enhances 
accurate referrals, and fosters digital guanxi between patients and 
urban doctors, reducing costs and limitations of spreading health 
information [22]. Moreover, ICT allows infomediaries to help pa-
tients become more motivated and empowered. Patients can learn 
more about their disorders and possible future conditions, help-
ing informed decision-making and appropriate actions [50]. For 
instance, patients can connect with fellow patients online, leverag-
ing weak ties to share experiences and strategies. Gage-Bouchard 
et al. [40] found that patients use online platforms to exchange 
specialized health information, such as health services, symptom 
recognition, and treatment protocols. These platforms also facilitate 
emotional support through empathy, comparing experiences, and 
ofering hope. The internet enables patients to adopt not only self-
directed inquiry strategies, with more medical consultation options, 
especially with specialists, but also collaborative inquiry and inter-
mediary strategies, connecting directly with fellow patients online 
who can refer them to high-quality medical providers. Therefore, 
ICT helps infomediaries bring parties together, inform decision-
making, and facilitate knowledge exchange, becoming central in 
the digital ecosystem [110]. 
To address challenges faced by patients with specifc disorders, 
we propose several future directions. First, personalized propaga-
tion and education based on disorder characteristics can be ben-
efcial. For instance, HFS patients, typically middle-aged to older 
adults, can beneft from ofine promotion eforts, such as regular 
free clinic sessions to enhance health and technical literacy. It is 
essential to boost patients’ confdence in and acceptance of technol-
ogy by promoting the understanding that technologies can serve as 
valuable sources of health information and provide a means to vali-
date existing information. While concerns about misinformation, 
fraud, and scams may lead to distrust in technology, these issues 
can also present in information obtained through social networks. 
Second, integrating technology into healthcare policies can provide 
substantial benefts. The government could provide telemedicine 
devices to rural patients, enabling remote access to top-tier medical 
consultations, enhancing health information accuracy, supporting 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Chan, et al. 
local doctors, and reducing patient costs [92]. Moreover, incorporat-
ing technology into infrastracture can be an efective approach to 
enhance technology acceptance and literacy. China had nearly 1.1 
billion netizens in 2024, with rural netizens accounting for 27.7%, 
reaching an Internet penetration rate of 63.8% in rural areas [31]. 
Notably, 36% of the increased users are people above 50 years old, 
attracted by the convenience and entertainment of short videos, 
instant messaging, online payment, and online medical care [31]. 
Third, large language models can serve as virtual doctors, allowing 
patients to ask medical questions anytime and anywhere. These 
models ofer reliable medical advice and show promising potential 
for integration into the clinical diagnostic process for rare diseases 
[19]. However, patients may perceive technology as inaccurate and 
unreliable due to ads and fraud on social platforms, and they are 
concerned about the impersonal nature of online information. To 
address these concerns, chatbots can be designed with more person-
alized, caregiver-like qualities and incorporate voice assistance for 
more natural interactions, thereby providing a trustworthy image. 
Moreover, integrating chatbots into online consultations with real 
doctors may improve patients’ confdence in the information pro-
vided. These advancements help mitigate information and power 
asymmetries in doctor-patient relationships, leading to better health 
outcomes. 
6 Limitations 
This study has several limitations. First, a low response rate led to 
a small sample size, limiting our ability to comprehensively depict 
circumstances in both rural and urban China. Second, remote inter-
views may have hindered rapport-building, potentially restricting 
insights into personal experiences. Third, the study focused solely 
on individuals with HFS in China. Future research should expand 
the participant pool and explore diverse national contexts for more 
comprehensive and comparative insights. 
7 Conclusion 
In this paper, we explore the health information-seeking practices 
of HFS patients by interviewing neurosurgeons and patients in 
China. Using Actor-Network Theory, we analyze the roles, interac-
tions and workfows of both human and non-human entities within 
the health information-seeking network. We identify fve strate-
gies for accessing top-tier medical resources, detailing their pros 
and cons. We disucuss how patients navigate health information, 
highlighting the empowerment through guanxi, strong ties, and 
the role of intermediaries. Despite the signifcant role of human 
infrastructure, the journey for patients is often long, difcult, and 
complex, involving numerous attempts to fnd adequate medical 
care. We propose implications for technologies to mitigate these 
challenges and empower patients. Our goal is to enhance research 
on patient engagement and to understand how healthcare practi-
tioners, designers, developers, and government can improve health 
awareness and information acquisition. Ultimately, we aim to help 
individuals with specialized disorder overcome information and 
power asymmetries in doctor-patient relationships, gaining better 
access to medical services and treatment options. Acknowledgments
