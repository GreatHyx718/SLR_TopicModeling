ABSTRACT
"‘イ(I)’(1926) by BioLuminescent Bacteria" is a work created by
printing an image on agar media using luminous bacteria as ink
through digital silkscreen printing. The printed image is the " イ(I)"
first displayed on a television CRT display by Kenjiro Takayanagi
in 1926. Unlike conventional printed materials, this image has a
temporal development. The luminous image gradually glows, then
deteriorates and vanishes as the luminous bacteria undergo growth
and die.

In recent years, research in the HCI field has often focused on
non-human organisms, exploring the concept of more-than-human
[5]. For instance, Pataranutaporn et al. proposed Biological HCI, a
framework for describing and designing interfaces between biologi-
cal systems, digital systems, and humans [ 12]. Kim et al. delved into
microorganisms, typically invisible to the naked eye, discussing
the necessity for a microbe-specific community within HCI [ 9]. A
parallel trend in the field of art practice, known as “bioart,” involves
the utilization of living organisms and molecular biology in the
creation of artworks [ 10]. Even within our interest in visual me-
dia, there are several examples, such as a work that employs squid
chromatophores as audio visualizers by Yokokawa et al. [ 17] , and
a project by Rotko that creates living images with yeast, aiming
to comprehend the relationship with the world, surroundings, and
nature [13].
Our work develops such curiosity in organisms other than hu-
mans on the edge of scientific research and art practice in HCI
by treating bioluminescent microorganisms as visual media. There
have been several precedents in the use of microorganisms as visual
media. Germ painting by Alexander Fleming in the 1930s is the
earliest example of the use of microorganisms for visual expression,
in which various pigmented molds and bacteria were used to depict
pictures instead of paint [ 6]. Hofmann created experimental type-
faces, “Mould Bold” and “Mould Inside,” using mold. Mold spores
grew on alphabet frames placed on a medium, forming the type-
faces during the growth process [ 2]. Nakagaki et al. harnessed the
characteristics of true slime molds to visualize the shortest distance
in a maze [ 11]. These practices incorporate not only the color of
microorganisms but also the temporal development of phenomena
like growth and movement in the creation of visual images. We
extend the context of such visual media practices by producing a
visual medium with temporal development, differing structurally
from contemporary digital displays.
2 LUMINOUS BACTERIA
Luminous bacteria, on which we focused, have the visual charac-
teristics of emitting light. Luminous bacteria, primarily found in
marine environments, exhibit bioluminescence when their popula-
tion reaches a certain density. Although their emitted light is faint,
it is visible when in the dark. Historical references to these bacteria
date back to Aristotle’s time [ 8]. During wartime in Japan, they
were partially used as an affordable and proliferative low-intensity
illumination during the Blackout [ 7][8]. In the present day, there
are studies that attempt to use luminous bacteria for 3D printing,
and Thomsen et al. converted luminous bacteria into living ink for
3D printers as a practice to design bioluminescence as a building
material and to explore what a living architecture is[ 15]. Binelli et al.

TEI ’24, February 11–14, 2024, Cork, Ireland Saeki and Jo.
used luminous bacteria for light-based 3D printing as living materi-
als with complex geometries and programmable functionalities[ 3].
The luminescence of these bacteria hinges on the availability of
nutrients and oxygen. Bioluminescence, in this context, is a form
of chemiluminescence initiated by oxidative reactions, with the
trigger linked to bacterial density [ 14]. This luminescence arises
from oxidative reactions involving a light-emitting substrate pro-
tein transitioning to an excited state. In the case of certain species
including fluorescent proteins, the excitation energy transfers to the
fluorescent protein, which becomes excited, leading to a reaction
akin to phosphorescence [ 16]. This process mirrors the emission of
light by a fluorescent material when subjected to an electron beam
from a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display, although the luminescence
of luminous bacteria is completed inside the body process. Photo-
bacterium aquimaris strain employed in this work contains a blue
fluorescent protein [18].
3 ‘I’
The life activity of luminous bacteria was associated with the image
of the CRT display, a visual medium that utilized the luminous
phenomenon and printed a symbolic character in the history of
CRT displays. The character " イ(I)" was the first image displayed
on a television CRT display in Japan by Kenjiro Takayanagi. While
television research was taking place globally, the Takayanagi ex-
periment employed a Nipkow disk as an image transmitter, and
a cathode-ray tube served as an image receiver. The Nipkow disk
converted the image into an electrical signal through raster scan-
ning. This electronic signal controlled the electron beam of the
cathode-ray tube and received the ever-changing distant image.
The electron beam, in turn, excited the phosphor on the surface of
the cathode-ray tube, resulting in the emission of light and drawing
scanning lines on the screen. Utilizing this mechanism, Takayanagi
achieved the first projection of the Japanese character " イ(I)" with
a resolution of 40 scanning lines.[4].
4 METHOD
This section describes a method of printing image using luminous
bacteria as ink and combining it with digital screen printing. Lu-
minous bacteria were cultivated in 100 mL of Marine Broth 2216
(https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/JP/en/product/sial/76448), a cul-
ture medium for marine organisms, for 24 hours at 17 °C within
an incubator. Subsequently, the bacteria liquid was pasted with
5% gelatin. The support structure was prepared by pouring agar,
dissolved in Marine Broth 2216, into a round glass dish previously
sterilized under high pressure. To print luminescent bacteria on
agar media, we used digital screen printing. Silkscreen printing, a
form of stencil printing, involves using a mesh plate with hollowed-
out characters and figures to apply ink. It is known for its versatility,
as it can be performed on various surfaces such as fabric and metal.
This printing method is highly adaptable due to the range of inks
available, making it applicable in diverse fields like printed circuits,
graphic design, and fashion design[1].
Digital silkscreen making is a computer-controlled automated
plate-making method based on binary images. The mesh is pre-
filled and then heat-punched in the plate making machine, making it
possible to easily produce fine prints such as small letters. To createa binary image of " イ(I)" with 40 scanning lines spaced 1.25 mm
apart, Adobe Illustrator, a vector graphics application, was utilized.
This image served as the basis for generating a digital screen plate.
For the screenmaking process, a digital screen platemaker called Mi
screen a4 was employed. The screen plate was then affixed to the
agar surface, and the image was printed by applying the bacterial
paste with a spatula from the top.
5 TEMPORAL DEVELOPMENT
This work was printed using luminous bacteria and a digital silkscreen.
Unlike conventional printed materials, this image has a temporal de-
velopment. The luminous image gradually glows, then deteriorates
and vanishes as the luminous bacteria undergo growth and die. In
this section, we show how the life activity of the luminous bacteria
produced a temporal development of the image. Immediately after
printing, the image was not visible because the bacterial density on
the support was insufficient for luminescence. After 12 hours, the
bacterial colonies were in the process of expanding and connecting
with each other, gradually forming the shape of a screen. After
18 hours, the image printed by the luminous bacteria was lumi-
nous clearly(Fig. 2). After 24 hours, the luminous bacteria, initially

creating scanning lines, began to transform into a surface as their
growth led to the lines collapsing and connecting both vertically
and horizontally. Additionally, there were light particles visible
outside the screen, likely originating from individual bacteria that
had proliferated. After 48 hours, the light dimmed from the center
as the bacteria continued to multiply at the periphery, and contour
lines became prominent(Fig. 3).
6 DISCUSSION
This work is a reproduction of Takayanagi’s イ(I)’ with luminous
bacteria and digital silkscreen printing. From the perspective of non-
humans organism in HCI, we would like to redefine luminous bac-
teria as design elements in visual media. The comparison between
the CRT display and luminous bacteria suggested similarities and
differences in self-illuminating picture elements and their temporal
development. The execution of this artwork was achieved through
digital silkscreen printing. This distinction is from precedents utiliz-
ing microorganisms. Images for digital plate making are generated
by vector image editing on computer. The resulting screen-printed

image is based on computer control. The screen’s grid structure also
implies that spatial information is discretized, resembling pixels.
Additionally, Photobacterium aquimaris used in this work emits
light by resonance transfer of energy from the luminescent protein
to the fluorescent protein (BRET). This is analogous to the electron
beam in a CRT display that excites the fluorescent material and pro-
duces an image of self-luminescence. Similar to the electron beam
and fluorescent material in a CRT display, digital slikscreen printing
allows the luminous bacteria can be positioned as components of a
computer-controlled image that is self-luminous.
The subsequent temporal development, however, is subject to the
uncontrollable biological activity of the bacteria. As these bacteria,
arranged in a pixel-like grid, proliferate, adjacent clusters connect
to create scan lines. The grid structure gradually disintegrates, and
the once-distinct lines merge or appear bacteria as points of light in
entirely different areas. Ultimately, as individual bacteria multiply
around themselves, the overall aggregate becomes less bright at
the center while illuminating the newly expanded periphery, i.e.
"Edges". Occurring over several days, yields a visual medium that
transforms dots become lines and surfaces by the life processes of
the bacteria. It is continuous and can be described as a temporal
development without a frame rate. In the contemporary digital age,
where images are expressed as pixels and frame rates, computer-
controlled digital displays can depict various images with temporal
development. Beyond the reproduction of images through external
means of computers like cameras and scans, computer graphics, real-
time generation through programming, and recent advancements
in generative AI technology permit internal image generation by
computers, which can then be displayed. Nevertheless, these images
remain constrained within the structural boundaries defined by
digital displays, with space delineated by pixels and time regulated
by frame rates.
The contrasting interrelationship between digital silkscreen print-
ing, which positions luminous bacteria as image components, and
the uncontrollable activity of luminous bacteria may allow us to
develop the structural boundary of visual media in HCI. By using
bacteria that have existed long before the advent of display tech-
nology, and by grasping their uncontrollable life activities as the
temporal development of the visual medium, this work may suggest
a way of images that is different from computer-controlled images.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
