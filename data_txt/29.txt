ABSTRACT
Design researchers and practitioners are turning to generative AI
(genAI) to support activities such as ideation and concept devel-
opment in pursuit of preferred futures. At the same time, genAI is
known to have biases, which prompts questions about how these
biases might adversely affect design practices. In the domain of
sustainable HCI, with its recent trends in human-nature interac-
tions and more-than-human design, the question can be further
refined into whether and how genAI biases might perpetuate an-
thropocentric biases that these practices are increasingly seeking
to confront. In the present research, we conducted three work-
shops, focusing on genAI for human-plant interactions; in the first
workshop, we created design fiction concerning human-plant in-
teractions in Southern California in the year 2100, building on the
second, the third workshop sought to identify and bring into focus
relevant units of analysis. Results included the identification of
three kinds of AI biases in plant representations that affect design
practices of future-making: species, ecologies, and interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION
The contributions of future studies in design include searching the
ways design methods and processes can be a means to imagine and
even consider design as a future-making practice towards more sus-
tainable societies [ 34]. Some of the notable methods and approaches
in this area are critical [ 5], speculative design [ 4,29], adversarial

https://doi.org/10.1145/3681716.3681738design [ 26], critical fabulations [ 67] and design fiction [ 12,22]. Al-
though diversely argued, what is shared across all these approaches
is a critical lens on the past, on practices, standards, status quo,
and mindsets already practiced in society, in an attempt to raise
awareness on social issues such as gender, race and nationality, and
other socio-economy-political discrimination. As such, they offer
or stimulate building visions for attainable futures, informed by
past and present real-world issues[ 29]. With all of the attention and
resources devoted to AI, trying to envision and beneficially shape
its contribution to our future–particularly in light of its training on
data itself steeped in various forms of discrimination and repres-
sion, design’s role in futuring is likely to feature AI simultaneously
as a key object of its inquiry, and also a toolby which that inquiry
is undertaken.
In other words, genAI has been added to the designer’s toolkit,
and thus is likely to contribute to future-making agendas in which
AI is featured. For example, the role of text-to-text genAI models in
creativity [ 78], or genAI as a collaborator, teammate, or tool [ 63] to
write fiction [ 35], to sketch [ 46] and to even contribute to creating
ideation tools such as mood boards [83].
At the same time, we are facing environmental and sustainability
issues such as climate change and loss of biodiversity; speculative
approaches have been contributing to address these issues by rais-
ing awareness, creating debates to empower people to imagine
and make futures that are more sustainable and just. For instance,
sustainable design fiction is a practice-oriented approach for in-
teraction designers to help see sustainable behaviors as part of
interrelated elements and remove the focus on individual behav-
iors and artifacts [ 81]. Akin to sustainable design fiction is nature
fiction. Nature fiction or ecofiction are stories related to the natural
environment and are concerned about human-nature relationships,
human responsibility towards nature and expanding the legitimate
perspectives to more than humans perspectives and rights [ 30]. In
the context of design, nature fiction is a speculative and co-design
approach that focuses on the relationships between people and
nonhuman stakeholders for example, in a garden and engaging
gardeners in the participatory process, which has implications for
broader concerns of imagining sustainable and more democratic
futures [ 65]. In another study on the use of speculative methods for
sustainability, the authors suggest thinking through them, when
we aim to use them in support of sustainability goals in HCI. The
authors offer provocations to designers seeking to use speculative
practice in support of sustainability goals such as who is specu-
lating and under what circumstances? what is held constant, and
what is variable? and what does this speculation risk? [71].
Thus, AI used as an ideation, speculative, and future-making tool
brings one of its biggest concerns to our attention: AI is biased. The
24

Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Maliheh Ghajargar
AI is trained and built upon human-created data, and so it perpetu-
ates the existing historical patterns of oppression, and potentially,
they become discriminatory technologies [ 18,59]. In the context of
genAI, researchers have found biased and discriminatory responses
from ChatGPT and in several popular text-to-image applications.
Particularly, the authors found systematic gender and racial biases,
as well as biases in facial expressions and appearances [ 90]. There
have also been concerns raised in many other areas, where existing
AI biases threaten transparency and ethical use of technology and
their associated risks, [ 42], for instance, in financial systems and
credit scoring [ 61], in HRI applications [ 39] and in Generative AI
[31, 73].
Because AI is trained on massive datasets that were created in
the past, AI reproduces them in the present and project them into
the future. Thus, we found friction between genAI bias and its tech-
nological capacities for sustainable future-making. In this paper, we
explore this friction by the research question: how can generative AI
perform in future-making processes (speculative design, creativity,
and design ideation) despite its biases? and what the capabilities and
limitations of this technological design tool are for future making?
This paper is part of a broader research project which aims to
speculatively study human-plant relationships through AI to con-
tribute to sustainable and more than human design approaches
through three workshops. The study of human-plant interactions
have been taken up in HCI community to support our connections
to nature and to go beyond Zoocentric perspectives [ 37], noticing
diverse forms of life in our surroundings and our entanglements
with other species [ 53] and towards establishing a more than human
agenda in human-plant interaction designs [ 52]. This agenda fo-
cuses on the agency, life, and sensing capabilities of plants as a form
of living and seeks to advocate for a non-utilitarian perspective.
Thus, we argue, and as we show in this paper, one of the AI’s
biases is its human-centeredness, which marginalizes nature in
general and plants in particular due to the zoocentric and human-
centric tendency of our design and technological approaches. This
paper offers reflection on how designers can use genAI for future-
making creative envisioning, and speculative designing in the con-
text of human-plant interactions (HPI), and how this can be ex-
tended to include other areas of HCI, such as human-AI interaction
and human-AI creativity.
This paper is structured as follows: We present related works
on human-nature interactions and their speculative approaches,
AI biases, and some of the roles that AI has played in ideation
and creativity processes. Then we present our methodology, which
includes three workshops conducted with students majoring in
design and design researchers. The results section focuses on areas
of genAI biases as they relate to human-plant interaction. We con-
clude the paper by reflecting on the role of biases in genAI and us,
in future-making processes.
2 RELATED WORKS
To position our work within the broader related areas in HCI and
design research, we outline three research streams that this paper
is informed by: (1) human-nature interactions and technology and
related speculative approaches, (2) AI bias and (3) AI for ideation
and creativity.2.1 Human-nature Interactions and Technology
Sustainable HCI [ 27], interaction design [ 11], more than human de-
sign [ 80] and Human-nature interaction design [ 48,49,70,72] have
been arguing for designing a more sustainable and just future for
humans and nonhumans, including humans and AI from an ecologi-
cal [88] and situated perspective [ 58]. In this area, researchers either
seek to use technology to mediate the human-nature relationship
or to consider nature as a participant in the design process under
the umbrella of human-nature interaction or multispecies design
[86]. For the purpose of this paper, we focused only on examples
that involved plants in diverse manners and situations (e.g., in a gar-
den, farm, forest, urban setting, etc.) and filtered out human-animal
interaction and human-microbial interaction design projects. For
instance, Wang designed and tested the growable jar lamp, with
the aim of encouraging people to notice plants and their values in
their everyday lives [ 84]. Similarly, Nam et al.’s FloraWear designed
artifacts that aim to mediate human-plant relationships. FloraWear
is another example and is a DIY, wearable living interface that sup-
ports noticing plants by growing them in a wearable, always in
touch with human bodies. Loh et al. particularly surveyed a series
of human-plant interaction design projects where plants played
different roles and offered ways that HCI can move from the view of
plants as utilitarian objects to plants as co-inhabitants contributing
to the more-than-human turn in human-plant interaction design
[52]. Bertran et al. developed a design methodology that facilitates
the co-design process in outdoor spaces insofar as to support our
endeavors in making nature a participant in our design processes
[2]. Rodgers et al. identified key human relationships with nature
through a probe study with the participants on their relationship
with their garden, inspired by Phenology, the study of cyclic biolog-
ical events [ 64]. Spors et al. conducted a scoping literature review of
human-nature interaction publications and identified four types of
interactions with nature: (1) nature as a research site, (2) depiction
and portrayal of nature, (3) modalities of encountering nature, (4)
understandings of nature [72].
Some other researchers have used critical and speculative de-
sign approaches [ 4,29] and design fiction [ 12,22,75] to study
human-nature interactions and relationships. For instance, sustain-
able design fiction is a practice-oriented approach for interaction
designers to help see sustainable behaviors as part of interrelated
elements and go beyond noticing individual behaviors and artifacts
as isolated [ 81]. Nature fiction in interaction design is a speculative
and co-design approach that focuses on the relationships between
people and nonhuman stakeholders in the garden, engaging gar-
deners, which has implications for broader concerns of imagining
sustainable futures [ 65]. In another study on the use of speculative
methods for sustainability, the authors offered four provocations
to think through when we aim to use speculative practices such
as speculative and critical design and design fiction in support of
sustainability goals in HCI, such as who is speculating and under
what circumstances? what is held constant, and what is variable?
and what does this speculation risk? [71].
What is shared among these works is an attempt to (re)connect
to nature and plants and, by that, speculate about, envision, and
make more sustainable futures, possible.

2.2 AI Bias
As algorithms are increasingly being weaved into our daily lives
at work, school, and home, several concerns related to ethics and
trust have been raised. One of the central concerns that affects trust
and ethical use of AI systems is bias. To ensure an ethical use of
AI, the HCI design community agrees that we need to make sure
that AI operates without bias. Although "bias" is understood in
different ways across different disciplines in law, HCI/computing
and social sciences, what technically and commonly is agreed upon
is what "[...] refers to AI systems that produce biased results that
reflect and perpetuate human biases within a society, including
historical and current social inequality", and that "Bias occurs when
the data distribution is not representative enough of the natural
phenomenon one wants to model and reason about." [ 74]. Attempts
to address bias issues in AI systems are either looking into the
dataset or specific APIs, while those in datasets are easier to address
due to the availability of dataset, those that originate from APIs and
the AI system are merely built upon already trained dataset, is more
difficult to detect and handle since the dataset is not available[74].
AI researchers have been developing techniques to support, test,
expose, and rate AI bias to build a trustworthy and ethical AI, such
as recruiting systems [ 28], or in customer segmentation, target
market goal settings for product developments in companies [66].
However, AI technologies vary in their structure and goals. Thus,
they may show different kinds of biases and potential consequences.
Generative AI is one of the technologies that have seen an increas-
ing proliferation and are increasingly available not only to creative
communities, such as designers and artists but also to the general
public. Hence, educating users of genAI and raising awareness on
the potential biases of these technologies are deemed necessary for
building trustworthy and ethical AI systems [ 54]. Large Language
Models (LLM) such as GPT-2/3/4, BERT, BLOOM, and many others
use pre-trained models to build and then are fine-tuned for specific
tasks. However, researchers have shown that the training data have
issues and encode stereotypical biases related to gender [ 7,45,77],
ethnicity, race and diverse-ability [ 9]. The authors demonstrate
that the size of the dataset does not guarantee unbiased decisions
and, for that matter, diversity. Particularly, several factors that limit
Internet participation (overrepresented by younger generations,
men and from developed countries [ 6]) and crawling methodology
do not help the diversity of the dataset either, as it most likely filters
out the voices of underrepresented and foreground (in UK and USA
English) white supremacist and misogynistic views, hence amplify
biases and harm associated with those biases [9].
Based on the examples of research projects provided in this sec-
tion, we can defer that AI indeed has biases, and the community has
been raising this issue to prevent unethical use of AI technologies,
specifically as it relates to the decisions being made on the future
of technological development, sustainability, and society.
2.3 AI for Ideation and Creativity
Creativity has been studied in design, engineering, humanities and
psychology research [ 24]. Tools that support creativity [ 68,69],
either digital [ 25,62] or analog [ 38], have been the subject of nu-
merous studies in HCI and design. Kim et al. researched how novicedesigners can use creativity tools or for novice ideas to create op-
portunities to grow by providing a safe space to experiment and
fail [ 43]. Cherry and Latulipe developed the Creativity Support
Index to measure the effectiveness of creativity tools based on six
dimensions [ 20]. Frich et al. call for a necessary, interdisciplinary,
and collaborative effort in creativity research between creativity
research in human-computer interaction on one hand and creativ-
ity in psychology on the other [ 33]. Biskjaer et al. researched time
constraints in CST creative writings [ 10] and Warr and O’Neil re-
searched the use of boundary objects as externalizations in the
Environment and Discovery Collaboratory (EDC) [ 85]. The design
of creativity support tools spanning from tangible tools (e.g., Son-
Ami [ 8]) to digital platforms and a mix of both (e.g.,[ 19]), has seen a
growing interest among HCI and design researchers. The use of AI
technologies in creativity processes have been rapidly increasing
during the last decades, and some argued that using AI in a creative
process promises more than just a tool for human creativity support,
throughout the years AI has been assumed to be and perceived as
a companion or a collaborator for humans [36, 63].
Perhaps one of the earliest models to support this creative dia-
logue between humans and computers was Mixed-Initiative Meth-
ods [ 60]. As defined by Walker and Whittaker, conversations in
social settings are of a mixed-initiative nature, that is, they are
about persons leading and taking turn to control over the conversa-
tion [ 82]. However, Liano et al., criticize computational creativity
approaches for their lack of support for negotiations and discus-
sions. The authors question the productive role of explainability
in computational creativity processes as they foster continuous
dialogues and interactions [ 51]. More specifically, as AI technolo-
gies have advanced over time, natural language models such as
GPT-3/4 were used for creative writing and storytelling, redefining
their role as they are perceived as collaborators or even as creative
partners [ 14,35,63]. These technologies have been deployed for
generative literature or generating an “interactive fiction world”,
allowing the users to see, read and talk to AI using language models
[3], or allowing to create applications for specific user needs such as
child-parent collaborative storytelling [ 89]. More recently, virtual
agents and their ability to collaborate in the creative process have
gained HCI researchers’ attention. For instance, Cobbie is a mobile
virtual AI that generates ideas with designers through iterative
sketches, which helped generate out-of-the-box or "unexpected
ideas" [ 46]. AI has also been used in more than human design pro-
cesses, often called for a care-driven approach [ 41] or an ecological
mindset [58, 88].
An emergent body of literature appears to argue for the use of
genAI specifically during the design processes. In these scenarios,
often designers are asked to generate ideas with the help of genAI,
given a project description. In one study, researchers found out the
capabilities of genAI to offer a "fresh form of self-expression and
communication," and genAI was particularly useful in bringing a
"distinct perspective" for artistic expressions [ 21]. Similarly, design-
ers found out that genAI improved both the efficiency of the design
as well as articulations of the ideas [ 78]. AI has also been used in
specific design contexts, such as FashionQ, which is an AI creativity
support tool for generating fashion-related design ideas [ 40] and
for choreography design [ 50]. AI was also employed to mimic and
improve traditional design ideation tools such as mood boards and
26
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Maliheh Ghajargar
collage tools [ 83], or to generate material for design fiction with
the theme of climate change [ 13]. The creative use of AI errors or
"hallucinations" in the ideation process has been investigated in
another work, where the authors created a dataset of AI errors,
such as misidentified objects or mislabeled objects, and worked
with designers on how to use the errors creatively in an ideation
process [47].
Researchers have simultaneously expressed excitement about
the capabilities of AI technology when they are used in creative
processes and raised concerns about its limitations and ethical
issues related to their inherent biases. We realize there are frictions
between the group of researchers that advocate for AI for creativity
and the group that is rightly concerned about AI biases and its
discriminatory possible future-making capabilities. In this paper
and in what follows, we probe that friction and examine it to see
how genAI performs in ideation and speculative process in light
of its biases in a series of workshops on the theme of human-plant
interactions.
3 METHODOLOGY
This project started by exploring the capabilities and limitations
of Generative AI (text-to-image and text-to-text) in ideation and
speculative processes [ 23,32,57,76]. More particularly, we were
interested to see how the frictions between AI biases and the act
of future-making fueled by creativity were productive (or not) in
employing speculative design methods for human-plant interac-
tions. To explore this area, we conducted three workshops. The
participants were 10 design students majoring in design, who were
working on design research projects under the supervision of HCI
and design researcher from Chapman University. The three work-
shops were conducted to aid students’ research projects within
the design research course called "AI Research through Design" at
Chapman University with the overall theme of designing AI-infused
products for human-plant interactions. Each workshop took about
2 hours and each participant was instructed to work individually on
a specific topic and to follow the related process. In the following
sections, we will describe each workshop’s structure and outcomes.
3.1 Design Fictions for Human-plant
Interactions in Southern California, Year
2100
The first workshop was to create a series of design fictions [ 12,75]
to envision future scenarios in Southern California in the year 2100.
Inspired by IKEA catalog project [ 17], the workshops aimed to
create fictional catalog pages for future interactions with plants.
The process unfolded in the following steps: (1) participants started
speculating on how their human-plant interaction design ideas
might evolve by the year 2100, considering technological, environ-
mental, and societal changes and generating multiple ideas and
scenarios; (2) next step was to select one of the ideas based on what
is most representative of the theme and most desirable related to
their design research question, and to develop a short narrative that
conveyed the essence of that idea —some suggested forms included
a day-in-the-life story, a news article from the future, an advertise-
ment for a new plant-related technology, or an op-ed from a future
inhabitant of Southern California. The narrative should include adescription of the interaction between humans and plants and how
this interaction is beneficial, challenging, or transformative, as well
as a glimpse into the culture or lifestyle of the time in Southern
California; (3) lastly the participants were asked to create a visual
representation of their narrative with genAI. They were instructed
to write the prompts using their own design narratives that they
composed in the previous step. This workshop took about 2 hours,
with a structure that allowed participants to discuss their individual
ideas with each other and with advisors, organizers, and our guest
speaker (Julian Bleecker, PhD from the Near Future Laboratory).
This workshop served as a starting point in ideating and envision-
ing a more sustainable human-plant relationship for the future. This
aimed to prepare participants for the next two workshops held a
month later and were both focused on generating ideas on concrete
AI-infused products for human-plant interactions.
3.2 Generating Ideas with GenAI Workshop
The second workshop instructed participants to interact with genAI
to generate ideas and variations for an AI-infused artifact related
to the theme of human-plant interaction. It is worth noting that
all participants have been working on developing design research
questions and product ideas since the first workshop was held (a
month before this workshop). This workshop specifically aimed to
help them to use their ideas, research questions and related theo-
retical backgrounds to compose prompts for genAI (Adobe FireFly).
We wanted to understand how our participants interacted with
genAI as a tool for ideation, sketching, and thinking [ 78] in terms
of writing the prompts, visualizing the ideas, and a reflective anal-
ysis of the process and outcome. We also aimed to observe how
participants tweaked their prompts to produce better results or to
overcome biases and stereotypical patterns. The process unfolded
in the following steps: (1) project description: the participants were
asked to write down about 100 words on the design idea and de-
scribe it in as much detail as possible. They were required to think
about the research questions, theoretical backgrounds, as well as
formal elements of their design such as the shapes, functionalities,
dimensions, materials, texture and the context of use; (2) iterative
prompt creations and image generations: the participants then used
projects descriptions to create 10 different prompts iteratively, each
containing at least 50 words. In this step, they were asked to write
prompts based on design variations, such as the same shape but
different colors, different people, plants, and different places, and
to generate images, then choose one of the images, iterate on the
prompt, write a new prompt for the next round of image genera-
tion, until they have 10 different prompts and generated 10 different
images. They were also encouraged to link their design ideas with
a theoretical concept such as multispecies empathy, an area of ap-
plication such as forest therapy, etc.; (3) reflection: the last step
was about reflecting on the process of interacting with genAI. The
participants were asked to reflect on the process and results and
write down their experiences, learning, unexpected results, biases in
generated images, and the degree of their control over the creative
process.

3.3 Designing Human-AI Creativity
Methodology Workshop
The aim of the third workshop was not much about observing the
process of generating ideas with genAI, but more about designing
a human-AI creativity process and experiment that is potentially
generalizable and replicable as a methodology. We were interested
in seeing how participants used genAI as a part of their design re-
search methodology and what the units of analysis are to evaluate
the performance of genAI in that process. For this workshop, the
participants were invited to (1) revise their original design researchproject description, but here with a particular focus on research
questions and the theoretical background of their research project;
(2) define units of analysis or testable hypothesis: they were asked
to think about how and based on which criteria they will evaluate
the AI-generated images against. This part was aimed to encourage
participants, based on their previous experience in workshop 2, to
envision the next, and to see possible outcomes of the process that
can be productive and generative in the analysis process and de-
velop units of analysis. Units of analysis are entities that researchers
focus upon in their process of observation and inquiry and which

are the focus of the research findings. They can be people, pro-
cesses, artifacts, practices, etc. In this workshop, participants were
provided with some examples of units of analysis, such as the rela-
tion between form-function and human-nonhuman design values,
accessibility, bias, stereotypical patterns, relation to the theory, etc.;
(3) After defining the units of analysis, participants visualized the
process step by step; (4) analysis: participants analyzed the creative
outcomes against the units of analysis, and wrote down about 200
words on the results of the analysis. The analysis also looked at
factors beyond the predefined units of analysis, such as if there were
unexpected results or results that could not be evaluated against
the units of analysis.
As mentioned at the beginning of this section, in all three work-
shops, we were interested in analyzing the participant’s analysis,
our observations, and genAI images as data against two units of
analysis: (1) biases in genAI and us. We were interested to see which
biases and whose biases are showing through this entire process,
whether we showed a selection, confirmation, or stereotype biases,
as they relate to human and nonhuman species representations, and
(2) generative capabilities of the entire process, involving genAI
for the future making practices, including design as an example of
such practices.
4 RESULTS
We thematically analyzed both the textual (e.g., promtps, reflections,
and projects’ descriptions) and visual data (genAI images) against
the units of analysis described in the previous section [ 15]. We
found three provisional, interrelated, and nonexhaustive thematic
patterns across data as they related to the biases representing plant
species, plant interactions, and ecologies.
4.1 Plants Species
The first one concerns the representations of plant species, which
are focused on the morphological features of plants and other rep-
resentative features, including the geographical origins, classifica-
tion, and naming of plants. As far as the plant species of a specific
geographical region are concerned, the design fiction workshop ob-
tained the most accurate and diverse results of regional biodiversity
whenever participants used Southern California in the prompts to
generate images for design fiction. The region’s climate is semiarid
and coastal, its plant biodiversity is characterised by evergreens,
big trees, succulents and palms, which were omnipresent in the
design fictions. However, the region is also one of the hot spots of
biodiversity, and as such, it has over 900 wildflowers in its moun-
tains, meadows, and deserts. A representation of wildflowers of the
region, such as yucca and California poppy was entirely missing.
Further, coastal plants such as silver lupines, as well as coastal ecolo-
gies, including nonplants and sea plants, were not included in the
visual narratives of design fiction, even in those that geography was
clearly stated in every prompt. Analyzing the prompts, we found
out that, in many of those used for design fiction, some generic
words such as "woods" (in Echowood ), "environment" and "native
plants" (in Urban plant Adaptive ), "greenery" (in Re:Life ), "natural
species" (in The Wisdom of Plants ), were used, which left the genAI,
to decide which wood or which native plants to represent. Thus, theresults were also generic and included a set of commonly known
native plants.
In the second workshop, we observed prompts that included
plants’ names. For example in Ethnobotany Garden , the prompts
featured names of specific plant species, such as "yucca plants, elder-
berry plants, and Chia plants living in this garden" which turned out
to be useful for genAI to illustrate specific plants species, but only
a few and of those that were again more commonly known species.
For instance, while it generated images of a common species of
yucca, the other species, elderberry, and chia plants, were not only
missing but were replaced with common cacti and other generic-
looking and even made-up plant species that were not mentioned in
the prompt. In several other projects such as Access to Nature , com-
mon native plants of the region were generated such as yucca and
palms, by only including "native biodiversity" and "native plants"
in the prompts. In the other two projects, such as Multispecies Em-
pathy , plants were mostly common household species, such as Zizi,
Monstera, and White Bird, which are not particular species of that
geographical region. The author of Echowood project used different
tree species names in the prompts, such as redwood, willow and
oak, and genAI was responsive to these prompts by generating the
species close to accurate with one exception of the willow tree,
which was presented similar to an oak tree with branches falling
down to mimic willow’s branches (Fig. 3).
4.2 Plants Interactions and Ecologies
This theme reports on our findings that were representative of
the relations, interactions, and ecologies of plants. For instance,
we observed the kinds of interactions in genAI images, prompts,
reflections, and project descriptions. The focus was on (1) ways
that interaction between plants and others, such as humans, other
plants, animals, technology, and other artifacts, were presented, (2)
ecologies and habitats, which included, for instance, places where
plants thrive or are disturbed. These were then clustered into two
groups of interactions with technology, interactions with habitats
and species (e.g., plants, fungi, animals, and humans).
4.2.1 Interaction with Technology. InEchoWood design fiction, dig-
ital technology and tree were literally entangled. LED light strips
that grew from the ground and continued on the tree trunk depicted
an image of a tree and technology both growing from one ground
(Fig. 1), recalling an ecological thinking in human-technology re-
lationships [ 88]. It is as if the soil provided nutrients to both trees
and digital technology. The plant salon design fiction also showed
different plants species (not native species) as co-inhabitants [ 53],
in an indoor environment featuring furniture, TV, speakers and
carpet (Fig. 1). In the Wisdom of Plants design fiction, we see tech-
nology (a mobile phone) is foregrounded on a background of plants
or the "greenery" (Fig. 1).
In workshop 2, the Multispecies Empathy focused on the futuris-
tic look of pots for plants and plants’ interactions with technology.
More particularly, it sought to produce images of plants in metallic
and glass-covering pots, which are plugged into a translating device.
The aim of this project was to design an AI-infused product that
supports human-plant communications through language trans-
lation (a kind of speculative LLM but trained on plants’ language,
capable of listening to plants’ communications and translating them
30

to human language). The generated images depicted a world where,
to interact with technology, plants had to be isolated from their
environment so the AI translator device could record plants’ voices
and translate those into human language (Fig. 2).
4.2.2 Interactions with Habitats and Species. InUrban Adaptive
Reuse , there were very little or no interactions between the urban
area and the plantation areas. It felt artificial and urbanized, reflect-
ing the design fiction narrative. Notable is also that there was not
much interaction between different plant species either, as each
species was exclusively interacting with its own species due to the
concrete plantation edges (succulents with succulents, palms with
palms) (Fig. 1). Perhaps the Re:Life is the most representative of
human-plant entanglements among the design fictions. It features
a human-like figure emerging from the soil under a young plant
seedling. The human figure and the soil share color and texture,
and they are in a glass test tube (Fig. 1). Re:Life is pictured in a lab
because the narrative intends to metaphorically picture a specu-
lative future based on rebirth with plants, intending to envision a
future where humans have closer and more intimate relationships
with plants. The generated image depicted that meaning literally
in a picture where humans and plants could grow together from
the same seed and from the same soil.
InMultispecies Empathy project during workshop 2, we observed
plant ecologies inside and outside of the pot. In most images, plants
were isolated from their environment as if they were kept under
controlled environments so that the AI device could capture their
voices and translate them into human language (Fig. 2). In another
project Multispecies Storytelling , trees were centered within the
image frame and were surrounded by humans, other plants, and
mountains. However, there was one exception where the tree was
in an urban area surrounded by tall buildings, and solar panels
noticeably were hanging down from her branches like fruits (in
the prompt: "tree’s leaves harness renewable energy to power its
AI-driven sensors and projections." Fig. 3).5 CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
In this paper, we do not claim to have conducted any future studies,
foresight, or future technology development research. We focused
our work on sustainable future-making capabilities of design and
creativity in the light of increased usage of genAI in the ideation
process and concept development, despite its biases. But nonethe-
less, we want to outline a few principles that guide future studies
before discussing the specific contributions of this work in depth.
First, futures studies concerns possible, desirable, and proba-
ble future developments, the conditions for these in the past and
in the present, and that the future is not entirely determinable
and that different futures are possible [ 1,44]. This is in line with
Tsing’s future-making as multiple more than human and mul-
tispecies world-building processes [ 79] which produce different
worlds, hence different futures.
Second, Donella and Dennis Meadows’s study (published in Lim-
its to Growth [ 55,56] was the first scientific study that did not
illustrate our technological futures and economic growth positively.
Instead, it described how our natural resources are limited and
cannot sustain our exponential growth of populations and needs.
The study warned and emphasized about "limits" to the stress we
possibly can put on our natural and social environments. That was
a "turning point" in how we want to approach the future of our
planet [44].
Our paper sheds light on several future-related aspects of inter-
actions with genAI and how its biases in a creative process may or
may not support making or unmaking futures.
5.1 Centredness: Human, Technology, Plant
GenAI was human-centered, or more accurately, it was perpetuating
our human-centredness. Human-centredness was sharply evident
in many projects, from generating an image where a human was
centered and foregrounded forest to more subtle perspectives of
human-centredness in technology design, such as anthropomorphic
robots that teach humans about ethnobotany and parks and trails
that were clearly designed for human use or devices for humans

use and interactions. Similarly, genAI seems to reflect a technology-
centred perspective, which made us reflect on whether genAI can
develop biases towards itself, like the ways we do. In the majority
of images, if there was a description of technology, such as "AI",
"smart device", "wearable", "wireless headphone", the technology or
the device became right away the central focus of the picture.
As far as the plant kingdom is concerned, genAI tended to be
"common-species-centered" as it almost failed to show the vast
diversity of plant species and often focused on commonly known
features of plants or specific kinds of plants that are commonly
known and representative of a geographical region, perpetuating
the presence of those already strongly presented and filtered those
endangered and less known species [ 9]. For example, genAI’s at-
tempts at visualizing tree species were the most successful ones,
which says about representation biases in genAI. However, what-
ever the reason might have been, unlike biases in representing
the human race and gender, this was not because trees hold the
most socio-political power in the plant kingdom over the Internet.
To paint a more transparent story, we should admit that names
of plant species were almost missing in the prompts; thus, it is
not surprising that genAI was not able to illustrate them. In most
scenarios, we saw generic words such as "wood", "environment",
"greenery", which left the genAI to decide based on the data it is
trained on which plants species or which native plants to represent.
Thus, the results were also generic and included a set of already and
commonly known native and non-native plants. This led to species
representation discrimination and exclusions of other plant species
by limiting the genAI to generate images of a small dominant group
of plants. However, it is also worth noting that even in those rare
cases in which we did include the names of specific plant species,
genAI performed selectively and represented only a few of them,
for example, in the Ethnobotany project (Table, 2).
Across all three workshops, it was challenging to get the genAI to
generate images that were not “perfect”. For instance, participants
had difficulty generating images of low-income communities that
lack green spaces or fruits and vegetables that were not perfectly
stereotypical; instead, genAI generated products without any sign
of imperfection or ordinariness. These led us to conclude and to
confirm earlier research that genAI has representation bias obvi-
ously [ 18,73]. That is, a group of plants is not represented in the
algorithm’s database. Further, it confirmed that AI is historical, and
it has a large capacity to remember things; as such, it does not forget
the past, nor does it interpret and speculate on the past; unlike us.
Hence, although not very often considered or applied, humans can
be more agile than AI in making different futures, by forgetting
from the past, or just learning from the past. Our learning from the
past can be different from AI’s learning, too. We, for example, may
learn from the past to avoid the same mistakes in the future; AI
learns to repeat the same story [16] by the power of "prediction".
5.2 Future Unmaking
Exploring the capacities of genAI in future making, unmaking, or
defuturing in Fry’s words [ 34] for a sustainable future felt naive
at first. It felt that we were giving genAI, a tool that is trained on
our imperfect and biased historical data, to change the course of
action the future may take, hence to unmake it and, as a result,supporting making futures that are sustainable for humans and
nonhumans cohabitations on the Earth. However, as we reflected
upon the findings of this research, we came across some glimpses
of it from an ontological design perspective [ 87]. We talk about this
by observing and analyzing cases where genAI did not do what we
expected it to do, in other words, produced "unexpected" and "unac-
ceptable" results. Starting with design features, genAI often failed
to illustrate and ideate devices with "futuristic" look in relation to
plants. In the Multispecies Empathy , the word “futuristic” did not
result in generating generic sci-fi futuristic looking images with
silver, concrete, and metallic surfaces, even if they were specified
in the prompts. Instead, it included more organic materials such as
stone and ceramic.
Another example was where genAI unexpectedly did not give us
a glimpse of sustainable urban areas with parks populated with the
biodiversity of native plants and transformation of already existing
low-income communities in Access to Nature : instead showed us
"very possible" spaces, or already existing ones. These unexpect-
edly not futuristic results, helped us to envision alternative futures,
rather than repeating old-futuristic and sci-fi looking and com-
monly imaginable futuristic products: "[...] it can use various design
aesthetics and still have the same impact and feel [of a futuristic
design]."
Lastly, from the ontological design point of view, genAI, as a tool
seemed to have changed the designers. In several reflective notes,
we observed that designers were reflecting on the changes these
workshops brought to their subjects and their practices. Some of
them were reflecting on what futuristic even looks like and how
it should look like; for others the genAI representation biases trig-
gered reflection on the need to learn about plant species’ names
and biodiversity of the region. One of them wrote: "It succeeds
in fostering interspecies empathy and deepening the connection
between human [me] and the natural world," which does not mean
that genAI was just or inclusive or sustainable, but that its represen-
tation biases resonated with them and helped them to empathize
with the underrepresented group of plants.
6 LIMITATIONS
This project comes with its own imperfections and limitations. Most
of the participants were senior design students, and although they
were informed that their work "should be sharable and aimed at
impacting an area of work within design and AI," still we should
consider these projects as school projects. Although many of them
will be design professionals in a few months, these works should
not be compared with what professional designers may produce in
similar contexts.
