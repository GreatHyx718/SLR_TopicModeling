ABSTRACT
Based on the coping theory and coping model of user adaptation, this research explores the 
impact of users’ ChatGPT technostress on cognitive appraisal, coping process, and behaviour. A 
survey using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk was developed to collect data on 10 occupations that 
may be replaced by ChatGPT in the U.S., with a total of 277 actual ChatGPT users. This study 
employs the software SmartPLS4.2 to evaluate the measurement model and the structural 
model. The results show that concerns over coolness and posthuman capabilities significantly 
affect users’ challenge appraisal of ChatGPT, whereas privacy, ethics, and security concerns 
significantly impact users’ threat appraisal of ChatGPT. Challenge and threat appraisals have a 
significantly positive impact on users’ problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, 
which themselves significantly predict users’ continuous use of ChatGPT. Mindfulness negatively 
moderates the influence on emotion-focused coping and continued use intention after ChatGPT 
adoption. The main theoretical contributions of this research include investigating users’ 
ChatGPT technostress and coping process by professional workers who may be replaced by 
ChatGPT. The evidence regarding the moderating role of mindfulness presented herein is novel, 
because the relationship between coping strategies and continued behaviour intention has not 
been previously examined.ARTICLE HISTORY

1. Introduction
The share of artificial intelligence (AI) in the marketing 
industry is rapidly increasing, in particular generative 
AI (such as ChatGPT), with up to 90% of commercial 
leaders planning to adopt generative AI solutions in 
the next two years (Dilmegani 2024 ). Generative AI 
(GAI) primarily operates through the generative pre- 
trained transformer (GPT) approach and undergoes 
training with an extensive amount of unannotated, unstructured data through a process called self-super
-
vised learning, resulting in the development of a foun -
dational model (Pham, Duong, and Nguyen 2024 ). 
GAI possesses benefits such as automation, high 
speed, and accuracy. For instance, ChatGPT, based on 
input prompts, can automatically generate articles as well as copy, code, and design proposals, graphics, or 
images. AI and human-machine fusion generally help 
employees to benefit from greater productivity, creativ
-
ity, and freedom (OpenAI 2023), but AI technology can 
negatively impact employee well-being. Business Insider 
compiled a list of ten jobs that ChatGPT could replace in 
2023, including tech, media, legal industry, market research analyst, teaching, finance, trading, graphic 
designer, accounting, and customer service (Zinkula 
and Mok 2024 ). While 49% of respondents still har -
boured worries about AI replacing their jobs, 70% 
were still willing to delegate a majority of their tasks 
to AI in order to alleviate their workloads (Tech 
Informed 2023). When employees discover that the 
knowledge and skills they have cultivated over the 
years may be replaced by AI, they can experience both 
anxiety and great psychological pressure (Kong et al. 
2021 ). Many people are struggling to cope with auto -
mation risks and job replacement fears due to AI tech -
nology – a condition known as GAI stress.
Four salient features characterise the extant literature 
on the GAI of ChatGPT. First, most research focuses on 
ChatGPT in different sectors (Catherine, Towfek, and 
Abdelhamid 2023; Ivanov and Soliman 2023; Pham, 
Duong, and Nguyen 2024; Ren et al. 2023) and how it 
can help to make customer service more efficient and effective for businesses (George, George, and Martin 
2023; Korzynski et al. 2023). Second, the quantitative 
analysis of evaluating ChatGPT’s understanding ability

(Lu et al. 2023; Zhong et al. 2023). Third, related 
research based on the technology acceptance model 
(TAM) has aimed to understand users’ attitudes and 
acceptance of ChatGPT usage (Polyportis and Pahos 
2024; Tiwari et al. 2023 ). Fourth, most research con -
siders the impact of psychological outcomes (psycho -
logical well-being and self-esteem) on users and the role of ChatGPT in shaping individual attitudes towards 
it (Salah et al. 
2023).
Although ChatGPT is increasingly popular and 
transformative, academic research on the user coping of ChatGPT technostress is quite limited, especially rela
-
tive to the available literature in the area. One dark side 
of ChatGPT is users’ heightened fears about its negative 
effects. While scholars and experts have discussed users’ 
growing concerns about job replacement and the priv -
acy risks of ChatGPT (Ritala, Ruokonen, and Ramaul 
2023 ), no definitive research to date has examined the 
impact of ChatGPT technostress enablers and inhibitors 
on users’ behavioural. Therefore, empirical examination impact of users’ ChatGPT technostress on cognitive, 
process, and behaviour becomes relevant. GAI technol
-
ogies both positively and negatively impact organisa -
tions and individuals in different ways (Zhao, Xia, and Huang 
2020 ), this study draws firmly from coping the -
ory (Lazarus and Folkman 1984), which can explain 
how a person evaluates and copes with stressful events 
(Oakland and Ostell 1996 ). Coping strategies are a col -
lection of possible responses to stressful situations. Pri -
mary and secondary appraisals are formed by evaluating potential outcomes of a stressful event. There are two 
main coping strategies: problem-focused coping and 
emotion-focused coping (Folkman and Lazarus 
1988). 
The problem-focused coping (PFC) strategy is akin to 
an approach style, while the emotion-focused coping 
(EFC) strategy is akin to an avoidance style (Srivastava 
and Tang 2018). Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2005 ) 
based on coping theory proposed coping model of 
user adaptation (CMUA). The CMUA framework can 
be applied to assess consumers’ adaptation in the light 
of their growing concerns about ChatGPT. For this pur -
pose, we rely on a sample of 277 actual ChatGPT users 
from 10 occupations that may be replaced by ChatGPT 
in the US and use structural equation modelling.
Since mindfulness can assist users in coping with the 
stress induced by information systems (Pflügner, Maier, and Weitzel 2021
). The literature has empirically estab -
lished the relationship between mindfulness and coping behaviour for technostress (Tuan 
2022). Mindfulness 
refers to deliberately paying attention to the present 
moment from an accepting stance, and individuals 
with a flexible disposition tend to sustain their life 
experiences (Tuan 2022). Mindfulness contributes to emotional regulation, alleviates stress, and enhances 
psychological well-being (Cheng et al. 2022; Guidetti 
et al. 2019). This study analyzes the moderating effect 
of mindfulness on users’ coping strategies and post- 
adoption continuation intentions in a ChatGPT usage 
context. To the best of our knowledge, no study has 
examined the moderating role of mindfulness in this 
relationship.
The presence of GAI represents a dilemma for com -
panies or workers due to its advantages and disadvan -
tages. In particular, there has been limited analysis 
from a stress and psychological perspective regarding 
users’ concerns about GAI and how actions are taken 
to address the sources of stress brought about it. The 
purpose of the present study is to use the coping theory 
and coping model of user adaptation to explore whether 
users’ ChatGPT technostress enables and/or inhibits their cognitive appraisal (i.e. challenge appraisal and 
threat appraisal) and type of coping strategies (i.e. pro
-
blem – or emotion-focused coping), and whether those 
coping strategies increase the likelihood of continued 
use intention after adoption. In addition, we investigate 
the moderating role of users’ mindfulness in continued use intention after adoption. Thus, our research ques
-
tions are as follows. 
RQ1. What are the roles of enablers and inhibitors of 
ChatGPT technostress by users on their cognitive 
appraisal?
RQ2. How do consumers evaluate and cope with the 
stress resulting from the effects of the enablers and 
inhibitors of ChatGPT technostress?
RQ3. How do users’ problem-focused and emotion- 
focused coping strategies impact their continued use 
intention after adoption?
RQ4. How does the moderating variable of mindfulness 
influence users’ coping strategies and continued use 
intention after adoption?
This research makes several contributions to the litera -
ture on technology interaction and ChatGPT usage 
behaviour. First, it proposes a structural equation 
model integrating users’ concerns, coping process, and 
behaviour intention based on the coping theory and 
tests the hypotheses derived from the model by data col -
lected from 10 occupations that may be replaced by ChatGPT in the U.S. Second, our study expands the 
coping theory and the coping model of user adaptation 
to understand how users respond to using ChatGPT in 
order to assess and deal with stress. Third, the evidence 
regarding the moderating role of mindfulness presented 
herein is novel, because the relationship between coping 
strategies and continued behaviour intention has not 2 
 Y.-H. CHEN ET AL.
been previously examined. Finally, the results of this 
study are based on data collected from ChatGPT 
users. Its findings offer significant insights for compa -
nies or individuals to understand GAI and bring forth new possibilities and challenges.
2. Component theories of the integrated 
model
2.1. Emerging concerns about enablers and 
inhibitors in ChatGPT
ChatGPT outperforms human workers in quality and 
efficiency on certain knowledge tasks (Gilardi, Alizadeh, 
and Kubli 2023 ). However, the data-rich business 
environment and its highly technological dynamics 
may generate behavioural and cognitive challenges (Bol -
dosova and Luoto 2019 ). Individuals must possess a set 
of AI-related skills to enhance their competitive advan -
tage, and literacy facilitation can reduce the technostress 
caused by ICT use (Sharma and Gupta 2023 ). We define 
GAI literacy as the ability to understand and use GAI 
tools effectively to make decisions. Coolness has been 
used to express elements of the novelty, originality, 
and attractiveness of technological devices (Lucia-Pala -
cios and Pérez-López 2023; Nan et al. 2022a, 2022b ). 
ChatGPT has outstanding language processing capabili -
ties as well as the ability to comprehend conversational 
content and to provide more accurate and relevant sug -
gestions (Kim et al. 2023 ; Stokel-Walker and Van Noor -
den 2023). We define coolness as an overall judgment of 
ChatGPT technology applications that are perceived as 
original, attractive, unique, and innovative. Intelligent 
systems capable of surpassing human intelligence in a 
particular field are considered post-human (Nath and 
Manna 2023), such as ChatGPT (Niu and Mvondo 
2024) and driverless cars (Gambino and Sundar 2019). 
Therefore, we define post-human ability as ChatGPT’s ability to handle work better than a human.
AI is gradually changing the way of working, and 
pressure on employees from data, information, and 
uninterrupted communication has also intensified 
(Sieja and Wach 2019). Kumar, Krishnamoorthy, and 
Bhattacharyya (2023
) indicated that role ambiguity, 
job insecurity, and the technology environment contrib -
ute to technostress, because of the deployment of ML 
and AI technologies. Li and Huang ( 2020 ) proposed 
and verified eight factors of AI anxiety: privacy violation 
anxiety, bias behaviour anxiety, job replacement 
anxiety, learning anxiety, existential risk anxiety, ethics violation anxiety, artificial consciousness anxiety, and 
lack of transparency anxiety. In fact, the rapid expansion 
and popularity of ChatGPT has brought privacy con
-
cerns, ethical concerns, security risks, and job replacement concerns. Data used by AI may infringe 
personal privacy (Jang 2023; Paul, Ueno, and Dennis 
2023 ). Therefore, we define privacy concern as the 
degree to which users are worried or stressed about per -
sonal data used by ChatGPT.
Many authors have pointed out their concerns over 
AI ethics (Hsieh 2023; Mvondo, Niu, and Eivazinezhad 
2023; Zhang and Zhang 2023 ). Although users find 
ChatGPT enjoyable and useful, it still has potential ethi -
cal issues. When users interact with ChatGPT, OpenAI 
collects a wide range of sensitive user information. 
These ethical concerns can influence their ethical per -
ceptions of ChatGPT (Catherine, Towfek, and Abdelha -
mid 2023; Niu and Mvondo 2024 ). In addition, the 
information security risks posed by ChatGPT can 
harm companies and compromise the security and priv -
acy of sensitive information (Carvalho and Ivanov 2024 ). 
For example, actions creating fake news or impersonat -
ing brands may become increasingly sophisticated (Kar -
anjai 2022). There is also a risk that personal data and 
other sensitive information may be used by ChatGPT 
to retrain the model (Kim et al. 2023; Paul, Ueno, and 
Dennis 2023). AI technologies and products are likely 
to replace some jobs (Bernazzani 2017 ), and unemploy -
ment or poor job prospects can generate personal 
anxiety. Wang and Wang ( 2022) and Li and Huang 
(2020 ) respectively proposed job replacement factors 
when studying users’ anxiety about AI. We define job 
replacement concern as the potential for ChatGPT tech -
nology applications to replace human jobs.
Despite the many advantages of ChatGPT, our 
understanding of the negative impacts of ChatGPT on 
users is rather limited in theoretical and empirical 
research. The insights gained from this study will help 
advance the knowledge and understanding of GAI tech -
nology usage.
2.2. The coping theory and the coping model of 
user adaptation
Coping is a series of processes that describe how indi -
viduals discover, evaluate, deal with, and learn from 
stressful situations. Lazarus and Folkman ( 1984 ) pro -
posed a widely accepted process-based stress and coping 
model that explains how a person evaluates and 
responds to stressful events. However, stress events 
can be assessed as a challenge or threat through cogni -
tive appraisal. A challenge appraisal occurs when a 
stressful event is challenging to an individual, but is seen as an opportunity for growth, resulting in positive 
emotions. On the contrary, a threat appraisal occurs 
when an event is perceived as causing a threat, foresee
-
able injury, or loss, resulting in negative emotions BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
 3
(Lazarus and Folkman 1984 ). If dealing with stress leads 
to positive emotions, then individuals can assess tech -
nology-related stress as a challenge; if stress leads to 
negative emotions, then they can be assessed as an 
obstacle (Zhao, Xia, and Huang 2020).
Coping strategies can fall into two perspectives on 
the basis of their function: problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping (Lazarus and Folkman 
1984; Xin, Siponen, and Chen 2022
). Problem-focused 
coping (PFC) refers to acting on the environment or 
self, emphasizing an individual’s initiative to directly 
respond to a situation and making efforts to manage 
or reduce stressors. When people feel that they can 
take some constructive actions, such as recognising 
reconstruction, acquiring new knowledge and skills, 
taking direct action to remove obstacles, and seeking 
support or help from others, they tend to adopt the PFC approach. Emotion-focused coping (EFC) refers 
to an individual’s inner efforts to regulate or reduce 
negative emotions caused by stress without affecting the stressor. When people believe that the stressor is 
something to be accepted and tolerated, such as positive 
reevaluation, emotional ventilation, seeking social sup
-
port, and ignoring the stressor (Carver, Scheier, and 
Weintraub 1989), then they tend to adopt the EFC 
style (Lazarus and Folkman 1984 ). Adopting a PFC 
approach means that individuals under pressure under -
stand the root causes of the problem, plan how to deal 
with it, weigh alternatives, and have confidence in 
managing their stress. Individuals who adopt the EFC 
approach want to manage their emotions, rather than 
change the situation or attempt to solve problems.
Beaudry and Pinsonneault (2005 ) proposed the cop -
ing model of user adaptation (CMUA) based on the coping theory. CMUA refers to the cognitive and behav
-
ioural efforts made by users to manage specific conse -
quences associated with major IT events that occur in their work environment. CMUA assumes that: (1) indi
-
viduals will conduct a primary assessment of the new 
information system (IS) (i.e. opportunity or threat), 
(2) the personal assessment of the new IS will lead to 
different coping strategies (i.e. PFC and EFC), and (3) 
individual responses to the new IS will lead to different 
results, such as improving efficiency and effectiveness, 
reducing negative perceptions of the situation, and 
restoring emotional stability. Therefore, the CMUA 
model can explain an individual’s coping behaviour 
related to IS. As AI technology becomes increasingly 
intelligent, it is more likely that it will surpass humans and may even make highly specialised occupations 
obsolete. The sudden change in work modes due to 
GAI can be difficult for users. The coping theory of 
Lazarus and Folkman (
1984) is applicable to understanding the process by which people adapt to 
new information systems. Therefore, this study aims 
to fill the gap in the literature and investigate users’ 
stress due to ChatGPT and their coping strategies.
2.3. User mindfulness
Kabat-Zinn (1994 ) defined mindfulness as being con -
scious, present, and unevaluated through concentration 
and specific perception. Langer and Moldoveanu ( 2000) 
defined mindfulness as the process of distinguishing 
new things, which enables individuals to notice new 
things and become sensitive to the environment. The 
nature of mindfulness can be divided into Eastern and 
Western perspectives (Kabat-Zinn 1982 ). The Eastern 
perspective of mindfulness has its origins in Buddhism, primarily focusing on personal awareness of the internal 
processes of the mind. The Eastern concept of mindful
-
ness includes the observation of both internal experi -
ences (such as thoughts, feelings, and body sensations) and external experiences (such as sights, sounds, smells, 
and events in the physical or social environment). The 
Western perspective of mindfulness focuses on how 
external experience deals with cognition, such as 
decision-making, problem-solving, and cognitive 
efforts. In other words, the alertness and consciousness of conscious individuals to their environment are 
expressed through the cognitive process.
The formation of mindfulness begins with state 
mindfulness, followed by trait mindfulness (Eberth and Sedlmeier 2012). State mindfulness refers to the 
consciousness of the mind, body, and other senses, 
while trait mindfulness refers to how individuals feel 
during and after mindfulness practice (Wang and 
Uysal 2023
). Specifically, this study defines mindfulness 
as a person’s increased attention and awareness of cur -
rent events and experiences without any ability to judge or attach importance (Brown and Ryan 
2003; Kumar, 
Krishnamoorthy, and Bhattacharyya 2023).
There are four distinct mechanisms (self-regulation, 
values’ clarification, flexibility, and exposure) through which the stress-reducing effects of mindfulness occur 
(Shapiro et al. 2006
). Mindfulness allows individuals 
to better adjust and deal with interference in the 
environment and makes it easier for them to focus on 
practical tasks (self-regulation). People with mindful -
ness have a goal orientation and know meaningful aspects of life and values that are important to individ
-
uals (values clarification). Mindfulness can achieve bet -
ter emotional and cognitive flexibility and takes 
environmental changes as opportunities by selecting 
or modifying them to meet their needs (flexibility). Mindfulness can bring experience, feeling, cognition, 4 
 Y.-H. CHEN ET AL.
and emotion, making people with mindfulness more 
willing to come into contact with unpleasant inner 
experiences (exposure). Sun, Fang, and Zou (2016) 
defined mindfulness from a technical viewpoint as a 
state of psychological consciousness in which a person 
pays attention to and is aware of the decision-making 
related to a technology adoption. Because people with 
mindfulness have a clearer understanding of the present 
moment, they may exhibit less impulsive behaviour 
(Tan et al. 2022), and people with higher mindfulness 
tend to feel less anxiety and emotional distress when 
faced with stressful relationships (Ardenghi et al. 2022).
Research has indicated that increasing mindfulness 
reduces negative appraisals and the adoption of more adaptive cognitive strategies, as employees are more 
likely to perceive demands as challenges rather than 
obstacles (Martín-Hernández et al. 2020). Therefore, 
users of mindfulness may perceive stressful situations 
as learning opportunities and advocate for the use of 
adaptive coping strategies (Gabel-Shemueli et al. 2023
). This study focuses on mindfulness as a personal -
ity trait and looks into the effect of mindfulness on the coping strategies of users and their continued use inten
-
tion after adoption. We posit that users’ mindfulness 
can moderate the relationship between coping strategies 
and sustained usage behaviour.
3. Research hypotheses’ development
Figure 1 depicts the research model tested by this study. 
The research model proposes that users’ ChatGPT technostress enablers and inhibitors trigger their coping 
process by affecting their challenge and threat apprai -
sals. However, challenge and threat appraisals are pro -
posed to positively affect PFC and EFC. The PFC and 
EFC are proposed to positively affect the intention to 
continue using ChatGPT after adoption. Furthermore, 
users’ mindfulness is proposed to positively moderate 
the relationships among PFC, EFC, and continued use 
intention after users’ adoption of ChatGPT.
3.1. User concerns and cognitive appraisal
3.1.1. GAI literacy
The advantages and potential of ChatGPT in knowledge 
work are significant. ChatGPT provides guidance and 
tips to enhance human capabilities and to complete 
human tasks quickly and effectively, thus greatly improving 
productivity (Ritala, Ruokonen, and Ramaul 2023 ). There -
fore, it is important for users to have technological literacy 
skills to use ChatGPT. Giudice da Silva Cezar and Maçada 
(2021 ) found data literacy to be negatively associated with 
perceived data overload and found a positive correlation 
between data literacy and individual performance. There -
fore, the following hypothesis is proposed. 
H1. GAI literacy positively relates to the challenge 
appraisal by users of ChatGPT.
3.1.2. Coolness
Coolness has emerged as a critical construct in human– computer interaction and IS research. Coolness is 
Figure 1. Conceptual model.BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
 5
associated with being unique, highly technological, out -
standing, and impressive (Warren et al. 2019). Coolness 
is considered a high-quality attribute that creatively 
fulfils a user’s goals (Sundar, Tamul, and Wu 2014). 
Coolness also refers to attributes or characteristics 
attached to a product or service (Warren et al. 2019 ). Per -
ceived coolness contains the four dimensions of utility, 
attractiveness, subcultural appeal, and originality (Sun -
dar, Tamul, and Wu 2014 ). The coolness factor of a pro -
duct contributes to its success in the market, as it plays a crucial role in how consumers perceive and engage with 
it (Niu and Mvondo 
2024 ). If individuals perceive them -
selves as part of mainstream culture, then they may con -
sider digital devices within the mainstream domain to be cooler than those associated with subcultures. Consu
-
mers typically believe that unique and cool products or 
services can trigger customer engagement motivation (Stocchi et al. 
2018; Wang and Sundar 2018 ). Cool pro -
ducts can also help customers achieve their ideal selves (Tiwari, Chakraborty, and Maity 
2021).
Scholars have explored coolness in the field of technol -
ogy products or services. Bogicevic et al. ( 2021 ) demon -
strated that perceived coolness mediates the influence of virtual reality on customers’ self-brand connections. 
Li et al. (
2022) assessed users’ perceptions of multiple 
dimensions of coolness and their usage intentions for 
digital products. Wu et al. (2023 ) explored the relation -
ship between delight and behavioural intention regarding 
the coolness of service robots. Tsaur et al. ( 2023) showed 
that perceived coolness positively affects customer 
engagement and memorable customer experiences. Niu 
and Mvondo (2024) determined that perceived coolness 
positively affects user satisfaction with ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is one of the impressive tools in GAI. It has 
the capability to enhance work efficiency and revolutionise content creation methods. ChatGPT is a versatile tool that 
complete a wide range of tasks involving natural language 
processing (Carvalho and Ivanov 2024). Therefore, this 
study predicts that coolness affects challenge appraisal. 
On this basis, a hypothesis is developed as follows: 
H2. Coolness positively relates to the challenge apprai -
sal by users of ChatGPT.
3.1.3. Post-human ability
The term post-human refers to individuals or entities 
existing beyond the human condition. From a digital 
information perspective, the integration of humans 
and AI implies that humans have become information processing entities that closely resemble AI (Hayles 
1999). Gambino and Sundar (2019
) argued that post- 
human refers to digital devices that outperform humans 
in specific tasks. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have seen rapid development, 
transforming the way individuals interact with their sur -
roundings and revolutionising work and business 
models. The post-human ability concept advocates the 
gradual blurring of boundaries between humans and 
machines, with humans endeavouring to expand their 
grasp of the future through the utilisation of technology. 
Studies have shown that ChatGPT’s performance on 
some knowledge work tasks surpasses the quality of 
human workers (Gilardi, Alizadeh, and Kubli 2023; 
Ritala, Ruokonen, and Ramaul 2023). Niu and Mvondo 
(2024 ) found post-human ability to have a positive effect 
on user satisfaction. Therefore, we propose the follow -
ing hypothesis. 
H3. Post-human ability positively relates to the chal -
lenge appraisal by users of ChatGPT.
3.1.4. Privacy concern
Privacy concern is an essential factor affecting user acceptance of AI-based technologies (Choi 2021; Li 
and Huang 2020). Various studies have investigated 
the impact of privacy concern on consumers’ attitude or its effect on information technology. For example, 
Marakhimov and Joo (2017
) studied adoptive health -
care wearable devices and concluded that privacy con -
cern negatively influences challenge appraisals and positively influences threat appraisals. Cai, Cain, and 
Jeon (
2022 ) found perceived privacy concern has a 
negative effect on both customers’ intention to use 
and their positive word-of-mouth about AI-enabled 
voice assistants. Simultaneously, research has confirmed that privacy concern and awareness of privacy risks 
undermine users’ willingness to use personalised ser
-
vices (Choi 2021).
Privacy concern is defined as the level of worry or 
stress experienced by users regarding opportunistic 
actions related to ChatGPT and their personal infor -
mation. Therefore, privacy concern is an essential factor 
affecting the threat appraisal of ChatGPT technologies. 
Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed. 
H4. Privacy concern positively relates to the threat 
appraisal by users of ChatGPT.
3.1.5. Ethical concern
When the boundaries between AI and humans become 
increasingly blurred, a series of ethical issues will follow 
(Kamila and Jasrotia 2023; Ryan and Stahl 2021; Zhang 
and Zhang 2023 ). Since the essence of AI is deep learn -
ing (DL) algorithms, the opacity of the internal oper -
ations may lead to a lack of transparency in decision- 
making (McGowan 2023). The ethical concerns 6 
 Y.-H. CHEN ET AL.
associated with using AI as an auxiliary tool involve dis -
trust, regulatory aspects, and responsibilities (Esmaeil -
zadeh 2020). Niu and Mvondo (2024) found that 
ethical concerns directly influence users’ satisfaction 
and loyalty towards chatbot services. Therefore, this 
study proposes the following hypothesis. 
H5. Ethical concern positively relates to the threat 
appraisal by users of ChatGPT.
3.1.6. Security risk
This study defines security risk as the degree to which users are worried or stressed about the accuracy and 
reliability of information obtained from ChatGPT. 
The security risks of ChatGPT stem from two main aspects: AI generation and training data input. Research 
has indicated that the cybersecurity risks posed by 
ChatGPT may jeopardise the security and privacy of 
sensitive information, potentially harming a company’s 
reputation (Carvalho and Ivanov 2024
). Another con -
cern is that confidential data shared with ChatGPT 
may be utilised as training data, potentially leading to 
output that mimics such sensitive information (Kim 
et al. 2023 ). Lastly, ChatGPT could pose a significant 
threat to cybersecurity, as it has the potential to signifi -
cantly amplify the creation and distribution of malicious 
content, such as spam, fake messages, phishing emails, 
and malicious software (Karanjai 2022). Therefore, we 
propose the following hypothesis. 
H6. Security risk positively relates to the threat apprai -
sal by users of ChatGPT.
Job replacement
Artificial intelligence has some negative impacts, among which replacing human job opportunities has received 
the greatest attention and discussion. Because people 
are afraid of being replaced, they find themselves in a relentless pursuit of acquiring more knowledge, inad
-
vertently leading them into a spiral of anxiety and stress (Li and Huang 
2020; Wang and Wang 2022). Scholars 
have pointed out that AI technology and products 
may replace some jobs (Bernazzani 2017 ). Conse -
quently, we hypothesise the following. 
H7. Job replacement positively relates to the threat 
appraisal by users of ChatGPT.
3.2. Cognitive appraisal and coping behaviour
When presented with opportunities for growth and 
enrichment, consumers tend to perceive stress as a chal -
lenge, but if stress impacts their well-being, then consumers may view it as a threat (Lazarus and Folk -
man 1984). Specifically, challenge appraisal refers to 
the perception that interacting with technology presents a challenging situation for an individual, but can be managed through appropriate coping efforts, thereby 
generating positive emotions. On the other hand, threat 
appraisal signifies the anticipation that one’s well-being or performance may be jeopardised due to encountering 
technological challenges, thereby generating negative 
emotions (Sharma and Gupta 2023).
This study defines challenge appraisal as the degree 
to which users appraise or evaluate ChatGPT use as an opportunity to enhance their work efficiency. How
-
ever, threat appraisal is defined as the degree to which 
users evaluate ChatGPT as a potential threat to their 
concerns and job replacement. Many scholars agree that challenge and threat appraisals both positively 
influence a person’s problem-focused and emotion- 
focused coping strategies (Lazarus and Folkman 
1984; 
Marakhimov and Joo 2017; Sharma and Gupta 2023). 
Thus, we have the following hypotheses. 
H8a. The challenge appraisal by users of ChatGPT posi -
tively relates to their problem-focused coping.
H8b. The challenge appraisal by users of ChatGPT posi -
tively relates to their emotion-focused coping.
H9a. The threat appraisal by users of ChatGPT posi -
tively relates to their problem-focused coping.
H9b. The threat appraisal by users of ChatGPT posi -
tively relates to their emotion-focused coping.
3.3. Relationship between coping process and 
behaviour
Scholars have tried to systematically understand and 
predict the intention to use ChatGPT by employing 
the TAM (Tiwari et al. 2023 ). Few studies have con -
sidered how users cope with the psychological stress fac -
tors caused by ChatGPT use, but scholars have realised 
the psychological impact of interacting with ChatGPT 
(Salah et al. 2023 ). Continued use intention after adop -
tion is defined as the degree to which users learn and use 
the functions of ChatGPT to support their work and 
well-being. PFC and EFC positively relate to the post- 
adoptive use of a technology (Marakhimov and Joo 
2017 ). In addition, PFC positively impacts learning sat -
isfaction, while EFC negatively impacts learning satis -
faction (Sharma and Gupta 2023). Huang and 
Dootson (2022) found that when customers engage in 
PFC or EFC strategies, their actions exert a positive 
effect on customer aggression. We therefore postulate 
the following. BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 
 7
H10. Problem-focused coping positively relates to con -
tinued use intention after users’ adoption of ChatGPT.
H11. Emotion-focused coping negatively relates to con -
tinued use intention after users’ adoption of ChatGPT.
3.4. Moderating effects of mindfulness
Mindfulness can help individuals cope with stress and 
select adaptive coping strategies by regulating their 
responses to stressful life events (Elhai et al. 2018; 
Grover et al. 2017). For example, when using direct 
problem-focused coping with stressful situations, mindfulness can enhance individuals’ ability to cope 
with stressful events and help them change the relationship between negative thoughts by focusing 
on current experiences (Pflügner, Maier, and Weitzel 
2021; Pirkkalainen et al. 2019
). In addition, mindful -
ness individuals are more likely to choose coping strat -
egies when facing a stressful situation (Tuan 2022). 
Mindfulness can cause individuals to adopt emotion- focused coping strategies to avoid or ignore stress 
(Weinstein, Brown, and Ryan 2009). Mindfulness 
effectively reduces anxiety, enhances positive emotions, 
and improves attention and cognitive abilities 
(Azpíroz-Dorronsoro et al. 2023; Wang, Berthon, 
and Bechwati 2021).
Several studies have confirmed that moderating 
effect of mindfulness is reduced stress or increased 
well-being (My-Quyen, Hau, and Thuy 2020
; Victor -
son et al. 2020). Furthermore, mindfulness can act as 
a moderating mechanism (Zha et al. 2015). For 
example, Pflügner, Maier, and Weitzel (2021 ) 
confirmed that mindfulness moderates the effect of 
perceived techno-stressors on job burnout. Mindful -
ness mediates the relations between both depression 
and anxiety sensitivity with problematic smartphone 
use severity (Elhai et al. 2018). Martinez et al. (2023) 
showed that mindfulness moderates the relationship 
between attributes of benevolence and post-purchase 
intention. This present study focuses on mindfulness as a moderator of coping strategies. We expect users’ 
mindfulness to moderate the effects of PFC, EFC, 
and continued use intention after adoption and 
hypothesise the following. 
H12a. Users’ mindfulness positively moderates the 
relationship between problem-focused coping and con -
tinued use intention after adoption.
H12b. Users’ mindfulness negatively moderates the relationship between emotion-focused coping and con
-
tinued use intention after adoption.
Based on the prior discussion, the research model pro -
posed appears in Figure 1.4. Methodology
4.1. Sampling and data collection
This study administered a structured online question -
naire through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (MTurk) plat -
form. MTurk is a widely used platform among scholars 
due to its high-quality responses and the naivety anon -
ymity of its respondents (Niu and Mvondo 2024 ). The 
subjects of this study were people living in the U.S. To qualify for the study, participants should meet the two questions were used: ‘Do you have experience using gen
-
erative AI tools?’ and ‘Are you one of the following occu -
pations that may be replaced by AI?’ These questions were used to identify individuals who had not used gen
-
erative AI tools and were not affected by AI, and these 
individuals were not questioned further. Therefore, 
20.9% (73 surveys) of the respondents are excluded 
from this study. The remaining respondents were asked 
to provide one of their most frequently used GAI tools, 
since they were likely to be familiar with them. In total, 
277 questionnaires were used for the analysis.
GAI users were recruited in January 2024 to fill out the 
survey. A total of 277 valid responses were used for data analysis and comprised 169 are male respondents 
(61.0%) and 108 are female respondents (39.0%). Respon
-
dents aged 25–34 account for 62.1% of ChatGPT users. The distribution of these respondents by age and gender is very similar to the use of ChatGPT worldwide in 2023 
statistics (Thormundsson 
2024). Most participants have a 
bachelor’s degree (72.2%), followed by a master’s degree 
(21.7%). Most occupations are in the technology industry 
(40.8%). About 51.3% of the respondents said they use 
GAI tools at least once four to five days a week, and 27.1% use them at least once a day. Table 1
presents the 
demographic characteristics of the respondents. In addition, we conducted a non-response bias test (Arm
-
strong and Overton 1977), and the chi-square test results 
showed no significant difference ( p > 0.05).
4.2. Questionnaire design and measures
The items of the questionnaire were derived from related studies, and we adapted and designed the question items 
to fit the context of this study. The measurement instru
-
ment consisted of 64 items and measured 13 research con -
structs. GAI literacy was adopted and modified from Giudice da Silva Cezar and Maçada (
2021) and was 
measured by using five items. Coolness was adopted 
from Niu and Mvondo (2024) and was measured using 
six items. Post-human ability was measured with two 
items modified from the topical literature (Gambino 
and Sundar 2019). Privacy concern (Marakhimov and 
Joo 2017) was assessed by four items, and ethical concern 8 
 Y.-H. CHEN ET AL.
was measured by employing five items from Niu and 
Mvondo (2024). Security risk was gauged by using four 
items from Weeger, Wang, and Gewald (2015). The 
three items for job replacement were adopted from 
Wang and Wang (2022) and Li and Huang (2020 ). Chal -
lenge appraisal and threat appraisal (Marakhimov and Joo 
2017 ) were assessed by eight items. The variables of pro -
blem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping were adopted from Marakhimov and Joo (
2017) and assessed 
by eight items. The Mindful Attention Awareness Scale 
(Brown and Ryan 2003) was assessed by 15 items. Finally, 
four items on continued use intention after adoption were 
adopted from Gupta et al. (2020 ). The demographic infor -
mation consists of gender, age, education, and occupation. 
All measurement items were identified from previous 
studies, with minor modifications to fit the context of 
GAI. Each item was assessed using a seven-point Likert scale, with scores ranging from 1 (not agree at all) to 7 
(absolutely agree). The measures and respective items 
are presented in Appendix A.
5. Results
IBM SPSS 26.0 was used to assess non-response bias, common method variance and demographic data. In this study, we consider the non-normal of the 
collected data and complexity of hypothesised model. 
We used partial least square structural equation model
-
ling to assess the measurement and structural model 
with SmartPLS 4.2 (Hair et al. 2017, 2021).
5.1. Measurement model assessment
Table 2 shows the results of the analysis. We delete six 
items whose factor loadings are less than 0.7. Other 
factor loadings are over the cut-off value of 0.70 
(Hair et al. 2019), and all constructs have variance 
inflation factor (VIF) values less than 4, suggesting 
acceptable reliability (Hair et al. 2017 ). Cronbach’s 
alphas range from 0.704 to 0.961 and exceed the rec -
ommended threshold of 0.70 (Nunnally and Bernstein 
1994). Composite reliability (CR) ranges between 0.841 
and 0.965, and average variance extracted (AVE) 
ranges between 0.572 and 0.742, thus exceeding the 
recommended threshold of CR greater than 0.70 and 
AVE greater than 0.50 (Hair et al. 2017 ). The measure -
ment model thus has high reliability and convergent 
validity. Table 3 shows results discriminant validity 
of the latent variables is tested using the Fornell and 
Larcker (1981 ) criterion. The square roots of the 
AVE values are all larger than the correlations. All 
values of heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) for con -
structs were lower than 0.9 (HTMT between 0.244 and 
0.893), which is the cut-off value (Henseler, Ringle, 
and Sarstedt 2015), thus supporting discriminant 
validity.
5.2. Common method variance
Given that both criterion and predictor variables were 
obtained from a single source (Podsakoff et al. 2003 ), 
the risk of common method variance (CMV) could 
be a concern in this study. We controlled for potential 
CMV by optimally designing the research question -
naire and placing questions related to the dependent 
variable before the predictor variables. We used 
second statistical methods to check for CMV. First, we adopted Harman’s single factor test (Podsakoff 
et al. 
2003 ). The total variance for a single factor 
was 35.95% (less than 50%), which met the cut-off cri -
teria (Mackenzie and Podsakoff 2012). Second, we 
used a latent marker variable to control the influence 
of CMV in the research model (Chin et al. 2013; 
Liang et al. 2007; Rönkkö and Ylitalo 2011). The 
results demonstrated that the path significance of the 
original model did not change after controlling the 
influence of the marker variable. Thus, CMV is not an issue in this study.Table 1. Demographics.

5.3. Structural model assessment
The R-squared results show that the endogenous con -
structs – namely, challenge appraisal (0.580), threat 
appraisal (0.555), problem-focused coping (0.596), 
emotion-focused coping (0.588), and continued use intention after adoption (0.709) – have large effects, 
indicating that the regression model is acceptable. 
Figure 2 shows the path coefficients and t-values. Of 
the inhibitors, GAI literacy has no effect on challenge appraisal (
β = 0.091, t = 1.071); thus, H1 is rejected. 
Coolness and post-human ability have a positive influ -
ence on challenge appraisal (
β = 0.550, t = 6.610; β =  
0.196, t = 3.607); hence, H2 and H3 are supported. 
Among the four dimensions of enablers, privacy con -
cern (
β = 0.345, t = 3.409), ethical concern (β = 0.206, t  
= 2.023), and security risk (β = 0.505, t = 5.416) have a 
positive influence on threat appraisal; hence, H4, H5, 
and H6 are supported. Job replacement (β = 0.172, t =  
1.556) has no effect on threat appraisal; thus, H7 is rejected.
Challenge appraisal positively influences problem- 
focused coping (
β = 0.741, t = 22.091) and emotion- 
focused coping (β = 0.739, t = 19.278); thus, H8a and 
H8b are supported. Threat appraisal positively influ -
ences problem-focused coping (
β = 0.117, t = 3.042) 
and emotion-focused coping (β = 0.100, t = 2.322); 
thus, H9a and H9b are supported. Furthermore, pro -
blem-focused coping (
β = 0.367, t = 6.438) and 
emotion-focused coping (β = 0.447, t = 8.426) positively 
influence continued use intention after adoption, thus 
supporting H10 and H11.
5.4. Moderation analysis
The structural model looks into the moderating effect of 
mindfulness on the proposed causal relationships among PFC, EFC, and CUIA. There is no significant moderation effect of users’ mindfulness on the relation
-
ship between PFC and CUIA (
β = 0.090, t = 1.355), and 
thus H12a is not supported. However, users’ mindful -
ness (
β = −0.139, t = 2.253; see Figure 3) has a negative 
moderating effect on the association between EFC and CUIA. Thus, H12b is supported.
5.5. Predictive relevance and effect sizes
We next calculate the effect sizes (
f2) for each path 
model. As a rule of thumb, values of 0.02, 0.15, and 
0.35 can be interpreted as small, medium, and large 
effects (Cohen 2013; Hair et al. 2019). The test results 
are in Table 4 . In addition, this study calculates cross- 
validated redundancy (
Q2) to assess the model’s out- 
of-sample predictive power or predictive relevance. Q2 
values larger than zero for a particular endogenous con -
struct indicate the path model’s predictive relevance for 
that construct (Hair et al. 2019 ). The Q2 values for CH 
and TH are 0.564 and 0.514, respectively, while the Q2 
values for PFC and EFC are 0.540 and 0.553, respect -
ively. The Q2 values for CUIA is 0.579. The demo -
graphic controls of gender and age do not significantly relate to the constructs (
Table 5).
6. Conclusions and implications
6.1. Discussion
This study examines how users continue to use ChatGPT in the inhibitors and enablers of technostress 
through the coping theory and the coping model of user 
adaptation. Additionally, it investigates the impact of user mindfulness on the moderation effect between 
PFC, EFC, and sustained use. First, the results show 
that coolness and post-human capability concerns sig
-
nificantly affect users’ challenge appraisal of ChatGPT. 
Coolness has the greatest impact on challenge appraisal. Table 3. Discriminant validity checks.

This finding aligns with other research suggesting that 
coolness and post-human ability positively influence 
the use of ChatGPT (Niu and Mvondo 2024). However, 
GAI literacy does not significantly affect challenge 
appraisal, although technical literacy or data literacy 
can help users manage stressors (Sharma and Gupta 
2023). GAI literacy should help users learn how to use 
ChatGPT so as to facilitate work and to increase their 
competence and confidence in using ChatGPT through 
training courses and learning mechanisms. Second, the 
results show that privacy, ethics, and security concerns 
significantly affect users’ threat appraisal of ChatGPT. However, security concerns (Carvalho and Ivanov 2024
) have the greatest impact on threat appraisal. Sur -
prisingly, job replacement does not significantly affect 
threat appraisal is a notable finding and is different 
from other research results (Lazarus and Folkman 
1984). This possibly because AI has yet to replace 
human labour on a large scale, and few workers have 
been replaced by AI. Most people will therefore not 
experience being replaced by AI (Li and Huang 2020). 
In addition, people view ChatGPT as an empowering 
technology that can help workers become more efficient 
in completing tasks or even create entirely new jobs

(Korzynski et al. 2023; Ritala, Ruokonen, and Ramaul 
2023).
Third, regarding the coping process, challenge and 
threat appraisals have a significantly positive impact 
on users’ PFC and EFC, which in turn have a signifi -
cantly positive impact on CUIA. These results are in 
line with those of other research (Marakhimov and 
Joo 2017; Sharma and Gupta 2023 ), which maintains 
that challenge and threat appraisals are the primary 
antecedents of the overall coping behaviour. However, 
challenge appraisal has a more significant effect on PFC and EFC than on threat appraisal, yet a stronger 
effect on PFC than on EFC. Most importantly, this 
study finds that mindfulness exhibits a negative moder
-
ating influence on EFC and CUIA.
6.2. Theoretical implications
This study has several academic implications. First, 
most research on ChatGPT has primarily focused on 
proposing conceptual impacts on industries or organisational sectors, with only Niu and Mvondo 
(2024 ) identifying the determinants of users’ loyalty 
and their ethical usage concerns related to ChatGPT. 
This paper is unique in that it empirically tests a research model drawing on the coping theory and the 
coping model of user adaptation. This study comp
-
lements the extant research on ChatGPT by identifying 
and empirically examining the effects of users’ enablers 
and inhibitors of ChatGPT technostress on their coping 
behaviour. The findings indicate that users’ coping behaviour significantly predicts their continued use 
intention after ChatGPT adoption. Second, most studies 
on technostress and coping perspective leave out the inhibitors (Pirkkalainen et al. 
2019; Zhao, Xia, and 
Huang 2020 ). Our study extends the existing knowledge 
by including both users’ inhibitors and enablers in the research model to study their effect on users in a 
ChatGPT environment. Third, as for the coping process, 
the results indicate that users’ PFC and EFC signifi
-
cantly predict their continued use intention after adop -
tion. This also implies people use PFC strategies when they feel they have control over a situation. Conversely, 
EFC strategies are used when a situation is uncontrolla
-
ble (Cheng, Lau, and Chan 2014; Chiavarino et al. 2012; 
Spekman, Konijn, and Hoorn 2018).
Finally, mindfulness is relevant to EFC (Elhai et al. 
2018 ). Mindfulness improves people’s ability to handle 
stressful conditions arising from technology. This 
results in improved well-being as well as reduced tech -
nostress and depression (Klussman et al. 2020; Kudesia, 
Pandey, and Reina 2022). In addition, Chang, Huang, 
and Lin (2016 ) confirmed that individuals with high 
mindfulness tend to use more PFC strategies in control -
lable stressful situations and rely more on EFC strategies in uncontrollable stressful situations. Similarly, Marsh, 
Perez Vallejos, and Spence (
2024 ) found that higher 
levels of mindfulness better protect individuals against 
the negative effects associated with digital work. In the 
current study, mindfulness fails to moderate the relationship between PFC and continued use intention. 
A possible explanation for this may be that use of GAI 
tools and ChatGPT innovative technologies are con
-
stantly being developed (e.g. GPT-4 language models), 
they will have a positive transformative impact on the 
industry (Dwivedi et al. 2024). Obviously, managers 
and users are still understanding, learning and adapting 
to the changes and negative impacts of ChatGPT on 
their work.

developers. First, while many companies have used AI 
techniques to automate processes, the greater impact 
of the technology may be to complement and augment 
human capabilities rather than replace them (Wilson 
and Daugherty 2018 ). ChatGPT will not replace 
human work soon, but employees from all walks of 
life should understand this new technology and learn 
to use ChatGPT to improve their workplace pro -
ductivity. Therefore, managers can promote the per -
formance of ChatGPT tools through social media platforms and allow users to learn online through 
videos. Second, ChatGPT’s coolness and post-human 
ability also influence users’ challenge appraisals. This 
provides a strong incentive for OpenAI and other com
-
panies building software applications based on transfor -
mer technology to develop and launch new features regularly and to create excitement over them. Technol
-
ogy designers should also strive to explore ways in 
which technology can surpass human capabilities (Niu 
and Mvondo 2024 ). For example, provide prompt 
engineering and AI dialogue communication strategies. 
Third, the results of this study indicate that users are 
indeed concerned about the inaccuracy and ethical issues of data obtained by ChatGPT. These concerns 
lead them to view ChatGPT as a threat. Managers 
should demonstrate commitment to user data security, privacy concerns, and mitigating ethical concerns 
about using ChatGPT. Fourth, GAI tools such as 
ChatGPT are expected to expand significantly in the 
near future. Organisations should alleviate the pressure 
level of GAI technology through timely and effective 
technical support. The coping processes among users 
of these technologies can significantly affect the pace 
and success of ChatGPT. Users who employ PFC strat
-
egies can create a plan of action to learn ChatGPT and 
as a result feel more confident and competent in its use.
Finally, mindfulness is a personal resource that can 
help reduce anxiety and technology related stress (Marsh, Perez Vallejos, and Spence 2024; Pflügner, 
Maier, and Weitzel 2021). Mindfulness helps to focus 
and calm can exert more creativity, which is relatively 
difficult to be replaced by AI. Consequently, managers 
and professionals are encouraged to maintain an open 
mindset, cultivate curiosity, experiment with ChatGPT 
and GAI tools, and build their learning capacities. 
Organisations also should provide employees with 
mindfulness training to reduce perceived GAI stress 
(Vonderlin et al. 2020), such as daily meditation practice 
(Lomas et al. 2017
), and promote their proactive pro -
blem-focused strategies to technological stress (Pflüg -
ner, Maier, and Weitzel 2021). In addition, training 
programmes can achieve balance through regulatory 
focus (promotion and prevention focus) (Tuan 2022). With adequate facilitation focus, employees tend to 
proactively respond to the technological pressures of 
generative AI.
7. Limitations and future research
This research had several limitations. First, this study primarily focuses on users’ enablers and inhibitors. Future research should consider a wider range of ante
-
cedents of the coping process, including the appli -
cations, benefits, and risks of ChatGPT. Additionally, this research considers how mindfulness affects coping 
processes. Future studies should explore other personal
-
ity traits, such as empowerment and having regulatory 
focus. Second, we used the MTurk sampling pool, 
which might decrease the external validity of the 
findings. This study may have been prone to self-selec -
tion bias, because the survey sample only focused on the 
distribution of ten occupations that may be replaced by 
ChatGPT. Therefore, other occupational samples 
should be further investigated in the future.
Third, the current research survey focused on U.S. 
professionals in selected fields, collected data from a sample of 277 actual ChatGPT users. While this sample 
size is adequate for many research purposes, which may 
not reflect diverse global contexts. Future research 
should consider the differences between countries in 
understanding the outcome of their concerns. Users 
from different countries may have different views on 
handling their concerns in a ChatGPT environment. 
Finally, this study examines users’ enablers and inhibi
-
tors, appraisal methods, and coping processes by col -
lecting cross-sectional data. For future research, it may 
be helpful to perform a longitudinal approach to obtain 
a more vigorous explanation of the causal relationships.
