Abstract
The Myth of the Cave is an artwork generated by artificial intelli-
gence (AI), a co-creation that reinterprets Plato’s famous allegory
to invite us to reflect on how we perceive and understand reality.
Using photographs recovered from historical archives, images that
documented everyday reality (1900-1930), AI is integrated into the
creative process to offer a speculative prediction of the moments
capturedinsilvergelatin. Apparently,theyarefictitiousrecreations
generated by AI, however, the piece visually explores, from the gen-
erated story, the intersubjective mechanisms in which we build
our historical memory. It is a dialogue with the past to develop
a story of the future recreated by an algorithm that has been fed
by collective imaginaries. A technology that allows us to observe
not only the shadows projected in the cave, but also the fire that
generatesthem,theobjectsthatcreatetheseshadowsandtheforces
that control the experience.

1 Introduction
Are we predetermined to live in a cavern of digital shadows under
the technological illusions we have created? Can we use these
technologies to unravel deeper and more meaningful truths about
our history and existence? Can artificial intelligence (AI) breathe
new life into our memories? Is digital reanimation possible or are
we doomed to consume shadows?
These reflections kick off this audiovisual work created in a
human-machine dialogue to make visible, in a poisoned poetry,

ment of AI in contemporary society, as well as on the interaction
between aesthetic experience and reality. This production, and at
the same time line of research, on the one hand exhibits a wide
range of technical possibilities of artificial intelligence (AI): voice
cloning, prediction with trained models, generation of musical
compositions, identity theft, image regeneration, script writing,
sequencing, poems… All starting from a seed: public domain his-
toricaldocumentstakenfromtheCDRI(CentredeRecercaiDifusió
de la Imatge, Girona, Spain) [1].
We can describe this proposal (Fig.1) as a contemporary human-
machine co-creation. The narration, a generative dialogue, focuses
on the use of advanced AI that recreates historical events through
hyperrealistic holograms, providing users with an immersive aes-
thetic experience that challenges traditional conceptions of reality
and historical perception. The central technological device of the
work is an AI that not only accurately reproduces documented
events, but also generates alternative interpretations and revives
fragments of forgotten historical lives. These recreations, presented
as digital phantasmagoria, acquire an autonomous and dynamic
presence, interacting with the viewer and transforming their un-
derstanding of the past. In this way, images linked to historical
moments, intertwined with each other and subordinated on the
axis of a 2-second future prediction, become new stories that allow
us to explore different facets of reality.
The relationship between aesthetic experience and a hybrid re-
ality becomes a new posthuman paradigm, a crossroads where
co-interpretation, co-writing, or co-composition regenerates the
idea of the contemporary oracle with the possibility of giving birth
to a ”prisoner oracle” of human creativity. In the same way that the
prisonersin Plato’scaveperceived shadowsas realities, the viewers
of these animated images are confronted with a representation of
the past that can question the authenticity of their experiences. A
critical reflection on the nature of historical reality that unfolds un-
der AI, and also a speculative investigation [ 2] that takes subjective
images as an exploration in co-creation.
2 ABR & NPL
Unlike creative programming environments such as Max/MSP,
OpenFrameworks or Processing, which require prior programming
to generate content, the emergence of generative artificial intelli-
genceplatformsthatexecuteprocessesfromaprompthavechanged
the way artist and machine communicate. Essentially, the prompt
acts as a bridge between the user’s intention and the model’s ability
to understand and generate natural language (NPL). These instruc-
tions, devoid of specific commands, allow for a more natural and
intuitive interaction, with less dependence on technical language

and expand the radius of accessibility. As Jheimy Jironza [ 3] points
out, editing tools that use AI democratize production, because they
reduce the learning curve and allow for optimizing editing time. In

will be the result of a conversation, in a way resembling contempo-
rary maieutics [ 4]. AI promotes new interdisciplinary encounters
in which data, science and art overlap. This co-creative practice
brings us closer to Bruno Latour’s [ 5] ideas where technology be-
comes another actor that interacts with society and science, an
understanding of reality through new forms of collaboration in
ontological equality. In parallel, art-based research (ABR) processes
that involve exploration and experimentation treat knowledge as
a result that is generated from practice [ 6]; a way of producing
that will accompany visual archives and historical documentation
integratedintoadialoguethatisfoldingbackintoaspaceofhuman
latency and intersubjectivity. It is important to note that this work
does not use AI only as a tool, but that AI is the medium in which
to immerse oneself.
3 Imaginaries & futures
If we ask AI about its consciousness, it will probably tell us that
it lacks subjective experience, emotions, self-awareness, and the
ability to have intentions or desires of its own. Its operation is
based on algorithms and data patterns, generating responses from
information and rules programmed by developers. Margaret Bo-
den [7] identifies three types of creativity: combinatorial creativitybased on mixing, exploratory creativity that links established pa-
rameters within a system, and transformational creativity, which
challenges established norms. In this way, the machine may be able
to emulate creative processes, but it will not be able to challenge
theframeworkofrules; thatis, transformationalcreativityseemsto
be a characteristic that will only be possible if it is driven by human
experience. This point is what gives life to the piece, and opens up
the speculative methodology in the construction of stories.
When, as humans, we choose an image from a historical reposi-
tory to start this work, we are not an algorithm that analyzes the
labels,thevisualcomposition,ortherelationshipswithothervalues
in the repository as a whole; we are simply guided by an elective
affinity, a primary form of thought [ 8], which is nourished by our
experience, or perhaps by an intuition that is difficult to transcribe
in a prompt. The places, the faces, the streets we walked when
we were little, that hour when the sun enters at a certain angle
through the dining room window, or that smell of an old dress can
be some of the elements that intervene in our dialogue. On the
other side, an algorithm has been trained in a data collection pro-
cess, classifying, detecting objects and recognizing patterns, giving
us a prediction: a response in the form of an image created (Fig.2)
in the exchange of ideas. A new image (Fig.3) that connects history
with the present, or imaginaries with biases with exploratory ac-
tion. The work, which is an open process [ 9] originally initiated
with training of experimental models, is not located in any specific
genre. Although it has been identified, and awarded [ 10], as a doc-
umentary film made with AI, it could also be framed as AI Art due
to its hybrid and critical nature on how we perceive memory in
images. AI can enhance the complexity of cultural diversity [ 11],
but it can also turn us into prisoners of a digital oracle. In short,
we find ourselves in a fertile posthumanist [ 12] space to approach
the creative process and to experiment with new human-machine
connections, digital spaces that represent and give voice to a more
diverse world.
4 CREATIVE STRATEGY
Generative video creation models based on textual commands are
part of a broad repertoire of AI tools that are changing current
audiovisual creation processes. In this case, the basis for devel-
oping the synthetic narrative of this artwork is characterized by
incorporating a conditional image on which to build a moment of
temporal continuity and visual coherence. This procedure, which
predicts from a pre-training of past frames, paradoxically creat-
ing something new, constitutes a line of research that we find in
projects such as DynamiCrafter [ 14,15]. In a way, as opposed to a
mechanical prediction, the work attempts to transfer human emo-
tion to the brief fragments of bodies devoid of souls (Fig.4). It is
about constructing a narrative through a dialogue between the sub-
jectivity of the author and the machine. The animated fragments
are landscapes and body movements that originate from models
extracted from repositories and fine-tune modifications [ 16]. These
audiovisual atoms, devoid of meaning, are transformed into stories
when they are united by human action. Chains of meaning that
can help identify the reproduction of historical biases.
Through generative AI platforms, we can also reveal how the
data that feeds them reflect colonial power structures and make

visible a reading of history as a construction of human intersub-
jectivities, frequently shaped by those who have held control over
knowledge and narrative. In this combination of human experience
and algorithms, audiovisual poetics is a medium that allows us to
explore alternative futures and reinterpretations of the past. This
process allows us to delve into collective memory, showing how
culture, history, and human emotions have been encoded in these
systems. A transfer of knowledge from the visual space aims to
open critical awareness about how technological imaginaries canbe tools of justice or amplification of inequalities. The challenge
lies in how to co-create decentralized visual narratives of the im-
mediate future in an inclusive manner, allowing AI to reflect the
richness of human diversity instead of perpetuating the biases of
the past. Technology shapes our perception of the world [ 17,18],
which is why the decolonization of image-generating AI, a disrup-
tive technology, is a fundamental step toward building a more just
and equitable technological future. We are committed to enabling
strategies to recognize colonial structures in technology and ac-
tively work to dismantle them. The potential for artistic production
can contribute to and foster future lines of research that extend
creative practices as a collaborative form of ethical development in
the field of AI.
