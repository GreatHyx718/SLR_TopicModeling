1 INTRODUCTION
In 1991 Professor Mark Weiser stated in “The Computer for the 21st
Century”,“Themostprofoundtechnologiesarethosethatdisappear.
They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they
are indistinguishable from it.” [ 24, p.94]. Since then, this seminal
paper has guided technology-based research and development, ev-
ident from its more than 20,000 citations. Indeed, over the past
few decades, a human-centered approach focusing on technology
design, development, and implementation for human needs and
comfort has become the dominant design approach. However, the

https://doi.org/10.1145/3686169.3686177externalities arising from this approach have contributed to signifi-
cant environmental problems and the climate crisis. For sure, the
Anthropocene has revealed the profound negative impact human
activities and human-made technologies have had on the planet,
as formulated by Hamilton, et al. [ 10] “with the adoption of the
Anthropocene concept we have to come back, superficially at least,
to a Buffonian view in which human history and Earth history are
commensurable and deeply interconnected”.
In response, the more-than-human movement within Human-
Computer Interaction (HCI) advocates for a radical shift in our
approach to design—one that decentralizes human needs and fore-
grounds the entire planet’s sustainability. Along these lines, we
suggest that Weiser’s observation of “disappearing technologies”
is a human-centered observation and as such, does not follow a
more-than-human approach. In other words, the planet is also an
actor in the design, development, and implementation of technolo-
gies. From a more-than-human perspective, these technologies
do anything but disappear as their environmental footprints leave
huge scars on the planet. It seems that Weiser’s definition of disap-
pearing is rather one of “out of sight, out of mind” for the users but
not for the planet as a whole. Thus, we propose the “more-than-
human” movement as an analytical lens to foreground the hidden
environmental footprints of disappearing technologies. Below we
discuss this approach and illustrate how it could be applied to some
of today’s emerging profound and “disappearing” technologies, e.g.,
GenAI, blockchains, electrical vehicles (EVs).
2 BACKGROUND ON THE
MORE-THAN-HUMANMOVEMENTWITHIN
HCI
The more-than-human movement within HCI represents a signifi-
cant paradigm shift, challenging the traditional field’s anthropocen-
tric focus [ 23]. Historically, HCI has focused on optimizing the
interaction between humans and computers, often prioritizing hu-
man needs, activities, and goals. However, this approach has un-
fortunately neglected the broader ecological and environmental
externalities of technological design, production, and use.
Rooted in interdisciplinary environmental philosophy, anthro-
pology, sociology, cultural geography and ecology influences (e.g.,
[25];[6];[15];[22]), the more-than-human movement advocates for
recognizing and incorporating the interests and well-being of
non-human entities, e.g., animals, plants, ecosystems, the planet—
into the design process. This perspective urges designers and re-
searcherstomovebeyondhuman-centereddesigntomoreinclusive
approaches that consider ecological and environmental externali-
ties. By expanding HCI’s scope to include more-than-human con-
siderations, this movement aims to foster a more holistic, ethical,
and sustainable technological landscape ([23];[7];[8];[3]).

HTTF ’24, October 21–23, 2024, Santa Cruz, CA, USA Mikael Wiberg and Robin Teigland
Several key principles characterize the more-than-human move-
ment. First, researchers propose decentralizing the human by
shifting focus from exclusively human users to a broader array
of stakeholders, including non-human entities, that are indirectly
effected [ 4]. When decentralizing humans, other things become
foregrounded, such as the environmental context in which tech-
nologies are implemented. This calls for a design approach that
acknowledges the interconnectedness [ 16];[17] of all life forms and
their environments and encourages designers to think about how
their designs interact with and impact natural ecosystems. Second,
this shift is an ethical shift – from acknowledging human needs to
also accounting for the rights and well-being of other non-human
entities [ 8]. This includes minimizing harm and promoting the
flourishing of all life forms. Third, the more-than-human approach
is fundamentally about sustainability and how to design technolo-
gies that not only reduce environmental impact but also actively
contribute to ecological regeneration and resilience. In this context,
“noticing” has been proposed as a method to foreground more-than-
human aspects. As a method and perspective “noticing” has been
defined as “a state of mind - an experience that is situated and
embodied, while being directed at the more-than-human world”
[17].
3 MORE-THAN-HUMAN AS AN ANALYTICAL
LENS - THREE EXAMPLES OF
“DISAPPEARING” PROFOUND
TECHNOLOGIES
We build on this concept of “noticing” [ 16];[17] and suggest that
a more-than-human approach can be an analytical lens to “make
visible” the externalities of technology design and use. In so doing,
we consider not only the human benefits and the affordances of
a technology but also its other-than-human effects, such as its
environmental footprint and how it influences a larger ecosystem,
thusaccountingforthetradeoffbetweenwhatthetechnologyoffers
humans and its effect on more-than-human worlds.
We argue that this approach is increasingly relevant as today
we are on the brink of the “disappearance” of yet another set of
digital technologies. For example, GenAI, blockchains, and EVs are
increasingly becoming woven into the fabric of everyday life, thus
becoming indistinguishable from it. Further, we see these technolo-
gies as “profound” as they are prophesied to be solutions to arrive
at the future, e.g., “AI is the future”, “EVs are the future”. From the
more-than-human perspective, we therefore seek to foreground the
invisible or “hidden” environmental footprint of each technology.
3.1 GenerativeAI
As formulated by Xu [ 26], AI is in its third wave of development
where AI is increasingly deployed at a societal level and integrated
throughout our everyday lives. Indeed, the GenAI hype is leading
to corporations, public sector organizations and individuals alike to
use these technologies without regard for their more-than-human
impact. For example, a well-reputed author on the future of work
recently encouraged those at an international conference to always
regenerate GenAI answers, claiming “ It doesn’t cost anything!”.
This is surprising as GenAI models require considerable process-
ingpowerandelectricitytoruncomplexmatrixoperationsonlargedatasetsoverprolongedperiodsonseveralhigh-performanceGPUs
or TPUs. For example, researchers estimated that creating GPT-3
consumed 1,287 megawatt hours of electricity and generated 552
tons of CO2 - the equivalent of driving 123 gasoline-powered cars
for one year, and this was only for preparing the model’s launch.
Furthermore, while GenAI is lauded to be a “key to the future”, the
World Economic Forum1noted recently that the energy required
to run AI tasks is “ already accelerating with an annual growth rate
between26%and36%,andthatby2028,AIcouldbeusingmorepower
thantheentirecountryofIcelandusedin2021 ”. GenAI also has an
expanding water footprint to cool data centers. According to Li, et.
al. [13], ChatGPT consumes 500 milliliters of water for every 10 to
50 prompts, depending on when and where it is used. Still, for the
average user, these tools are invisibly located “in the cloud” rather
than being viewed as an exponentially expanding environmental
problem.
3.2 Blockchains and cryptocurrencies
Blockchains and cryptocurrencies provide several societal benefits,
such as decentralization, transparency, and security within indus-
tries such as financial services and logistics. They are most famous
for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether. These benefits do, how-
ever, come at a major and frequently invisible environmental cost
([5];[20];[2]). The most well-known is the energy-intensive mining
process, particularly in Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus
mechanism. To verify transactions and safeguard the network,
mining entails resolving intricate mathematical puzzles, requiring
enormous processing resources. As of August 2022, the total global
electricity usage for crypto-assets was estimated to be between 120
and 240 billion kilowatt-hours per year or 0.4% to 0.9% of annual
global electricity usage2. This is greater than the total annual elec-
tricity usage of many countries, including Argentina and Australia,
andiscomparabletotheannualelectricityusageofallconventional
data centers in the world. While increasingly using renewable en-
ergy sources, fossil fuels are still primarily the main energy source,
which results in significant CO2 emissions. Again, this speaks to
the invisible scale of this problem.
3.3 Electric vehicles
Electric vehicles (EVs) are agued to cut greenhouse gas emissions
within transportation, halt global warming and provide an alter-
native to fossil fuel-driven vehicles. Compared to conventional
vehicles, EVs are advertised as having a large environmental advan-
tage([9];[12];[14]), buttheyalsohavehiddenenvironmentaleffects
([11];[21];[19]). For example, 1.9 tonnes of water are required to
mine one tonne of lithium, with 15 tonnes of CO2 emissions in
the process. To mine lithium, cobalt and nickel, hazardous chemi-
cals and extensive manual labor (sometimes even child labor) are
used in areas where water is scarce with runoff contaminating
underground water sources3. Moreover, China produces 77% of

all batteries, using coal as its primary energy source. Finally, EVs
generally weigh more than their counterparts due to their battery
packs. The average EV weighs 1.9 tonnes with the largest SUVs
almost 3 tonnes, e.g. Mercedes EQV at 2.96 tonnes, Audi e-tron 55
at 2.72 tonnes4. No wonder some label this development as “the
green paradox”.
4 DISCUSSION
As we are now “halfway to the future” to echo the symposium’s
theme, it is also time to reflect on our direction. If the 21st cen-
tury was the century of “disappearing technologies”, what will the
22nd century be about? The current movement suggests a radical
shift from the human-centered approach to a more-than-human
perspective. We appreciate this shift in terms of how it foregrounds
non-human entities and how it makes visible the environmental
footprintsofdisappearingtechnologies(fromahumanperspective).
However, currently there seems to be a dichotomy between
“human-centered” vs. “more-than-human” centered approach, with
researchers suggesting that we need to shift to more-than-human
perspectives and values [ 27]. Further, more-than-human scholars
suggest that there is no dichotomy between the two, and following
that philosophy we should not create new divides but rather look
at approaches integrating these two, as we still have many human-
related problems to solve (e.g., UN SDGs). In this context, HCI
research could drive the agenda for the design and development of
systems that not only design along the principles of user-centered
design and user testing but that also include at least critical re-
flections on their environmental footprint (ranging from natural
resources used to electricity to power these interactive systems).
Also, we as humans have the resources, capabilities, and respon-
sibilities to design and envision more preferable future states. We
should take this responsibility and design both for humans and
for more-than-human worlds. To do this requires a holistic un-
derstanding of not only what technologies can do for us but also
what they do to the planet. We should keep a keen eye on the
more-than-human and think about how such efforts in return also
solve human-related problems. While technology should “disap-
pear” in the Heideggerian sense of working as effective tools that
are “ready-at-hand”, we also need to ensure that such profound
technologies do not disappear – from a human-centered perspec-
tive,whilebeingverypresentfromamore-than-humanperspective.
To ensure this, we need to ensure that this duality is constantly
foregrounded in active discussions on how the technologies we
design must benefit the planet and not just serve human needs and
comfort. Ultimately, we might realize that once a technology starts
to “disappear” (from a human-centered perspective), then we need
to urgently look for how it appears from other (more-than-human)
perspectives-includinghowitinfluencesotherspecies,ourclimate,
and our planet in the long run. We suggest that the more-than-
humanapproachis exactlyonesuch fruitfullens toseethese things
holistically - across humans and more-than-human actors - to con-
stantly keep an eye on the technologies we design and adopt in our
everyday lives and how they affect other lifeworlds. With this as a
central and unifying perspective, a vision for the 22ndcentury can
be formulated. Here, we should not just look for how “profound

these technologies at the same time re-appear – for other lifeforms,
and for more-than-human worlds.
