Abstract
Advances in interaction design, architecture, and artificial intel-
ligence offer new possibilities for built environments. Yet, most
systems focus on improving physical parameters such as indoor
air quality. While these enhance physical comfort, they often over-
look an innate aspect of human experience—our connection with
nature—fundamental to physical and mental health. In contrast,
architecture offers a rich legacy of biophilic design that creates
sensory-rich spaces evoking a connection to nature. What insights
can biophilic architecture offer to guide interactive experiences in
future buildings? Drawing on 13 expert interviews, we expose the
gap between current biophilic practices in smart buildings and the
multidimensional potential of nature-inspired design. We present

1 Introduction
Interactive systems are integral to building design, leveraging ad-
vances in sensing, actuation, and data processing to regulate param-
eters such as lighting, temperature, and air quality [ 2]. These sys-
tems enhance comfort, energy efficiency, and sustainability while
adapting spatial layouts to create private or collaborative spaces
within shared environments [ 34,94,95]. However, this approach of-
ten embodies an anthropocentric and technocentric paradigm [ 46],
treating buildings—and the technologies within them—as functional
spaces optimised for productivity [ 53]. This perspective neglects
the potential to enrich deeper, experiential dimensions, such as
those rooted in our innate connection to nature [66, 68, 133].
Biophilia refers to the intrinsic human tendency to seek connec-
tions with nature and other forms of life [ 133]. Biophilic design
builds on this, advocating for the integration of natural elements,
patterns, and processes into the built environment to support mean-
ingful connections with nature. This approach is grounded in a
growing body of evidence demonstrating that a biophilic connec-
tion yields psychological and physiological benefits, including stress
reduction, cognitive restoration, and enhanced creativity [43, 51].
In architectural legacy, biophilia is deeply embedded. Traditional
methods have employed natural materials and site-sensitive layouts
to promote ecological awareness, sensory engagement, and emo-
tional connection [ 18,66]. For instance, an ancient Indian temple
at a river’s origin cyclically submerges during monsoon season,
symbolising purification and renewal—of both the building and
the soul—while reinforcing human-ecological ties [ 45]. Similarly,
Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater in Pennsylvania exemplifies this,
blending the built form with the surrounding waterfall1.
Despite this legacy, biophilic design remains underutilised in
smart building technologies, which rarely explore how interactive
systems might foster deeper, multisensory relationships with nature.
There is a need to integrate biophilic principles into smart building
research, towards environments that are not only advanced but also
ecologically and experientially rich. Human-Building Interaction
(HBI), which explores technologies, spaces, and subjective experi-
ences [ 1,10,101], offers a promising context for this integration.
By acknowledging emotional, cultural, and sensory dimensions,
HBI can support environments that promote well-being, nature-
connectedness, and sustainability for “human flourishing” [85].
This paper explores the following question: What insights can be
drawn from the legacy, practice, and imaginaries of biophilic architec-
ture to guide the design of interactive experiences in future buildings?
Through interviews with 13 architecture experts, we investigate
the potential of biophilic design within the context of current and
future smart buildings. We acknowledge biophilic design as a recip-
rocal practice benefiting both humans and nature, though current
discourse remains largely human-centred; our perspective focuses
on expert insights rather than normative prescriptions.
Our analysis reveals a gap in current practices and the possi-
bilities of nature-connected interactions in buildings. We present
seven high-level topics (TO1–TO7) that offer a structured overview
of expert discourse, followed by eight themes (T1–T8) that capture
how professionals imagine the future of biophilic design. These
1https://fallingwater.org/themes provide a conceptual foundation for nature-inspired inter-
actions in indoor spaces. Next, we introduce five design opportu-
nities (DO1–DO5) supported by emerging technologies to enable
novel biophilic interactions. By bridging architectural biophilia
with interactive technologies, we expand the discourse on smart
buildings—reimagining how nature can be integrated into indoor
experiences and reorienting biophilic interaction as reciprocal and
aligned with more-than-human, justice-oriented futures.
2 Background and Related Work
We first review biophilic design in architecture, then examine its
treatment in HCI and Interaction Design (IxD), highlighting gaps
and situating this work within these fields.
2.1 Biophilia and Its Treatment in Architecture
Edward Wilson popularised biophilia as humanity’s evolutionary
need to connect with nature, an “innate tendency to focus on life
and lifelike processes”[ 133]. This connection extends beyond phys-
ical contact, encompassing emotional, cognitive, and ecological
awareness[ 124]. A greater interaction with nature strengthens this
connectedness, and those with stronger connections actively seek
more nature-oriented experiences [124].
Architecture has long reflected this interdependence between
humans and natural environments. Traditional Japanese tea houses,
for instance, embody concepts like wabi-sabi, valuing authentic-
ity, ageing, and transience, with designs that extend into the sur-
rounding landscape [64]. However, modern industrialisation led to
building practices increasingly detached from ecological context. In
response, architects like Frank Lloyd Wright championed “organic
architecture”[ 91], while Ian McHarg’s Design with Nature promoted
ecological integration[ 87]. Stephen Kellert later formalised biophilic
design into a set of principles such as natural lighting, material-
ity, and biomimicry that could be embedded into human-centred
design frameworks [ 68]. Today, biophilic design is being revisited
as a response to climate change, urban stress, and declining na-
ture connectedness. Initiatives like the Living Building Challenge2
promote regenerative design through green roofs, vertical gardens,
and water recycling. Contemporary examples include Singapore’s
Gardens by the Bay3, Apple Park’s ecologically integrated campus4,
and Maggie’s Centres [ 117], which use natural light, greenery, and
views to support healing and well-being.
2.2 Human-Nature Interaction in HCI
HCI has explored the intersection of technology, people, and na-
ture through areas such as Human-Nature Interaction and Natural
Interaction [ 55]. NatureCHI studies how people use technology in
natural environments [ 50], and Outdoors HCI designs for wild or
semi-wild spaces [ 62,88] like gardens [ 105] and farms [ 79]. Recent
reviews highlight strategies to enhance human-nature relation-
ships through technology, including engaging with urban nature,
bridging indoor-outdoor experiences, and supporting personal nar-
ratives [ 88,114,128]. While these approaches emphasise interaction

in natural settings, our work focuses on built environments. We ex-
plore how occupants can form intrinsic, multisensory connections
to nature indoors, using biophilic design to reimagine how smart
buildings support nature-connected experiences.
2.3 Biophilia in IxD for Indoor Built
Environments
Biophilic interaction design (IxD) in indoor environments typi-
cally focuses on fostering (a) connection to nature, (b) restorative
experiences, and (c) ecological awareness [ 102]. Designs aiming
to establish nature-connection often tend to keep the nature of
the “connection” broad. Digital “windows” simulate outdoor land-
scapes to foster a sense of connection with nature [ 38,126]. Soft
robotic flowers evoke playful, memory-rich interactions [ 27,86],
while nature-inspired wallpapers use dynamic lighting and touch-
activated soundscapes to extend these sensory links [20].
Restorative systems replicate nature’s psychological and phys-
iological benefits, especially in spaces where direct access is lim-
ited [ 83,96]. For instance, plant-like movements (i.e. responding to
plant-generated electrical signals) and surfaces with cellular struc-
ture patterns were explored in confined spaces for restoration [ 107].
Nature Jar uses digital metaphors of growth to encourage mind-
fulness and restoration [ 127]. Other works remind people to take
breaks through nature-inspired technologies, directing their minds
toward nature as a means of relaxation [ 63]. Generative art has
also been used to create biophilic displays, offering evolving visu-
als for stress relief [ 135]. Immersive experiences, such as Virtual
Nature , leverage virtual reality (VR) to simulate restorative natural
environments.
To promote ecological awareness , some designs embed nature-
inspired cues into daily life. For example, sensor-embedded plants
nudge users into taking stairs instead of elevators, saving energy [ 80].
Wearable devices like FloraWear , offer tactile, mossy surfaces, to
signal nature interdependence [ 92]. Playful digital games have
also explored biophilic design for promoting pro-environmental
behaviour in the built environment among children [33].
2.3.1 Sensory Modalities in Biophilic Design. Biophilic design aims
to evoke feelings of being in nature through multisensory engage-
ment. Visual elements like projected greenery or simulated nat-
ural lighting are widely used to evoke feelings of being in na-
ture [ 5,35,136]. Auditory soundscapes mimicking birdsong or
flowing water have been shown to enhance nature connected-
ness [ 5,35,136]. In contrast, modalities like touch, smell, and taste
remain under-explored despite their immersive potential. Some
works combine multiple senses. Touch and visual interactions were
explored in Nature-bot , which comprised robotic flower-like dis-
plays made of different materials to encourage playful interac-
tions [ 27,86]. Similarly, LiveNature combined tactile sensations
through wool (evoking contact with sheep) with ambient displays
for connection to rural environments [ 38]. Few explore sensory
integration: Living Wallpaper responds to touch with birdsong and
motion-triggered fading prints [ 20], while one installation blended
visuals, sound, and smells to evoke river landscapes [131].2.4 Gaps and Positioning
We see that existing biophilic research in IxD often broadly fo-
cuses on fostering connections to nature or enabling experiences
of restoration and ecological awareness. Much of this work is frag-
mented, with limited exploration of the diversity of human experi-
ences with nature such as sensory engagement, ecological interde-
pendence, and cultural narratives [125].
This paper draws on architectural perspectives to surface expert
imaginaries and explore new possibilities for biophilic interaction in
smart environments. Rather than offering precise definitions of bio-
philia or prescriptive technology design guidelines, we foreground
conceptual and speculative insights rooted in biophilic architec-
ture. Our goal is to broaden the discourse on biophilic interactivity
in smart buildings across HCI, architecture, and IxD, and to lay a
foundation for future empirical studies and design explorations.
3 Methodology
This section outlines the research methodology used to investigate
expert insights on biophilic design, detailing the interview design,
participant selection, and data analysis approach.
3.1 Expert Interviews
We conducted semi-structured interviews, chosen for their flexi-
bility to explore experts’ unique insights while maintaining a con-
sistent structure across sessions [ 12]. A prepared “interview guide”
outlined core areas of discussion with open-ended questions to
encourage experts to be reflective and forward-thinking, while
providing flexibility to tailor the conversations to their expertise.
The conversations were organic, primarily driven by the experts’
insights, with the guide serving as a loose framework to ensure
relevance and depth, rather than dictating the flow of discussion.
Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional review board.
All experts provided verbal and written consent. Interviews were
conducted in person or online, lasting 60–75 minutes.
3.1.1 Interview Design. Conversations were loosely structured
around experts’ context, grounded insights, experiential perspec-
tives, and visionary outlooks—balancing practical inquiry with
speculative thinking. Context-setting focused on situating ex-
perts within the framework of biophilic design while exploring
their interpretations of its philosophy and its relevance within
smart environments. Grounded insights explored practical design
and engineering considerations, financial restrictions, technical
challenges, and limitations. At this point, experts were invited to
share their insights on opportunities for incorporating the different
sensory dimensions to foster immersive connections to nature. Ex-
periential perspectives drew on personal stories and case studies
where nature-inspired design created profound connections. Finally,
visionary outlooks invited experts to imagine future biophilic
spaces that respond to emerging human and ecological needs.
3.2 Selection of Interviewees
Experts were recruited via email through purposive sampling [ 110].
We reached out to individuals with significant contributions to
biophilic design and related fields, including those affiliated with

leading, global architecture firms, high profile architecture and de-
sign projects, as well as distinguished academic contributions. As
the interviews progressed, snowball sampling was employed, lever-
aging existing experts’ networks to identify additional experts [ 103].
In this way, we invited 25experts of which 13participated. Among
them, 8 were industry experts, including lead architects and se-
nior designers (urban and landscape), while 5 were from academic
backgrounds, comprising researchers specialising in interactive
architecture and environmental psychology. A summary of partici-
pant demographics along with their stated expertise in biophilic
design is provided in Appendix B.
3.3 Data Processing and Analysis
We conducted 13 expert interviews, resulting in approximately
17 hours of recorded audio, which were transcribed and analysed
through a multi-stage process. Our analysis yielded findings at three
levels: (1) topics summarising the interview data, (2) reflexively
constructed themes around expert imaginaries in biophilic design,
and (3) design opportunities. Figure 2 summarises this process.
3.3.1 Step 1 – Topic-Level Clustering of Expert Responses. We be-
gan by organising the interview data using the structure of our
interview questions (c.f. subsection A.1 and discussed under Inter-
view Design). We then grouped similar responses and identified
recurring ideas. From these patterns, we developed a structured cod-
ing scheme (Figure 3) comprising high-level topics such as values ,
deeper connection , and technology . These topics summarise expert
discourse and surface the breadth of insights across the interviews,
reflecting a high-level, descriptive structuring of the dataset.3.3.2 Step 2 - Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Next, to elicit deeper
insights from the dataset, we conducted a bottom-up reflexive the-
matic analysis following Braun et al . [16] , Byrne [22], which al-
lowed for an iterative and open coding process. Reflexive thematic
analysis was chosen for its effectiveness in identifying and inter-
preting patterns across datasets, particularly in under-researched
areas [ 17,30]. This analysis was conducted independently of Step
1, where we returned to the full dataset and carried out line-by-
line coding of the transcripts. Each sentence was examined with
attention to both semantic and latent meaning, yielding 471open
codes (e.g. “spirit of the place”, “participatory stewardship of nature”,
“biophilic design as corporate culture” ). These codes were iteratively
reviewed and refined to create themes that reflect the possibilities
of biophilic design, as articulated by the experts.
3.3.3 Step 3 – Deriving Design Opportunities. Finally, we engaged
in an interpretive synthesis to develop design opportunities for
interaction design in smart environments. This process drew from
the structured topics (Step 1) and reflexive themes (Step 2), re-
examining the findings through our designerly and technological
lens. For each opportunity, we also proposed speculative technol-
ogy examples using “what if?” scenarios to explore how biophilic
interaction might be reimagined.
Throughout the study, the first and last author discussed and
resolved methodological and analytical decisions. The first author
identified high-level topics based on the transcripts, which were
then reviewed and refined (Step 1). The first author then conducted
open coding and theme development, with codes and developed
themes discussed and adjusted in joint meetings (Step 2). Finally,
the first and the last author iteratively reviewed and shaped the
design opportunities (Step 3).

4 Findings: Topic-Level Clustering of Expert
Responses
This section presents the seven topics (TO1–TO7) derived from our
topic-level clustering of expert interviews, offering a descriptive
overview of how experts conceptualise biophilic design in smart
buildings. An overview of the seven topics and their relationships
is provided in Figure 3.
TO1 - A Deeper Connection to Nature: Experts spoke of design-
ing for a “deeper connection to nature” in indoor spaces as a core
philosophy underpinning biophilic design [ 67]. Beyond evident
health benefits, they suggested that deeper connections could be
fostered through existential moments of awe and humility, shifting
perspectives from controlling nature to reflecting on humanity’s
place within it. Experts stressed the importance of designing spaces
that celebrate ecological uniqueness, recognise nature as an ac-
tive agent in fostering respect, and encourage participatory care
for natural spaces. They also highlighted integrating non-human
ecosystems, such as pollinator habitats, into human environments
to shape behaviour, foster biodiversity appreciation, and challenge
cultural assumptions that separate humans from nature.
TO2 - Limitations and Criticisms: Experts criticised reliance
on visual perception as the primary sensory dimension for design.
While impactful and accessible, this overemphasis neglects oppor-
tunities to create more immersive multi-sensory experiences. Addi-
tionally, experts pointed out the dilution of biophilic philosophy
over time through superficial approaches such as the use of fake
plants that prioritise aesthetics over authenticity and fail to reflect
natural processes. A lack of ecological coherence was also discussed,
with many designs featuring token, isolated elements that fail to
provide ecological continuity with the surrounding spaces.
TO3 - Sensory Design Opportunities: Experts highlighted the
underutilisation of smell, sound, and taste in biophilic design. Smell,
despite its emotional and memory-triggering capabilities [ 54], is
often avoided due to concerns about undesirable natural odours.
Sound practices focus on noise reduction (also pointed out by
Spence [113] in his work summarising multisensory design) rather
than leveraging natural auditory elements like birdsong to enrich
sensory experiences. Taste is rarely addressed, limiting its potential
in specific, niche contexts (e.g. [ 59]). Experts also spoke of oppor-
tunities for biophilic spaces that respond to human movement to
enhance users’ sense of self and foster stronger connections to
their environment. Multi-sensory designs that facilitate medita-
tion, immersion, and exploration of nature’s systems (e.g. microbial
systems [104]) can provoke curiosity.
TO4 - Technology: Experts put forth the notion of “smart na-
ture” or “extra nature”, considering technology as a design material
for biophilic experiences in architectural spaces. In addition to
climate-responsive innovations like hydro-gel windows that regu-
late sunlight for occupant comfort [ 139], they proposed technology
such as reactive biophilic booths , retrofitted with lighting, air quality,
and sound sensors, as a modern extension of sun-bathing booths
to provide intense, immersive nature-inspired experiences. Experts
also discussed leveraging relatively “low-fi” technology such as QR
codes and mobile applications as digital cues to prompt interactionwith natural elements. Generative AI was highlighted for its poten-
tial to create innovative visual biophilic designs [ 108,135], while
Mixed Reality (MR) technologies were suggested for their ability to
blur artificial and natural environments.
TO5 - Socio-Economic Challenges: Experts surfaced regula-
tory, economic, and technical constraints that limit the extent to
which biophilic design is implemented in indoor spaces. Reliance
on nurseries for specific plant species can pose logistical challenges,
while project tender processes often prioritise cost efficiency, sti-
fling opportunities for creative and sustainable solutions. In her-
itage areas, strict preservation laws and morphological constraints
complicate efforts to balance cultural preservation with ecolog-
ical improvements. Experts also highlighted trade-offs in urban
environments where vertical expansion is favoured, compromising
ground-level connectivity and ecological continuity.
TO6 - Biophilic Design Values: Experts discussed the impor-
tance of embedding societal values such as neurodiversity [ 19],
feminism [ 14], and community justice [ 40] into biophilic design
for indoor spaces. They also highlighted the need for these envi-
ronments to cater to marginalised and transient communities that
can benefit from nature connectedness for emotional and phys-
ical healing. Artistic expression through storytelling and spatial
design was identified as a means to reflect community identity (as
done by [ 109]). By integrating local narratives into natural spaces,
biophilic design can strengthen cultural ties and foster deeper per-
sonal connections to nature. Experts also noted that collaborative
approaches could empower communities to actively care for and
sustain these environments.
TO7 - Speculative and Future Visions: Experts envisioned
future biophilic design that can create integrated ecosystems within
indoor spaces, such as biotopes and ecological corridors, to support
building wildlife (previously discussed at a city scale [ 140]). These
participatory ecosystems were seen as fostering species coexistence
and offering novel experiences, including moments of discomfort to
enrich nature interactions. They also proposed emotional biophilic
spaces designed to adapt to body rhythms, emotional states, and
gender-specific needs. This vision included incorporating natural
rhythms, such as tides and seasonal changes, to evoke a sense of
belonging to larger natural cycles. Experts also suggested leverag-
ing natural light to create transparency and reflections, evoking
concepts like infinite vistas and horizon views.
5 Findings: Thematic Analysis
We present eight themes (T1–T8) developed through a bottom-up
reflexive thematic analysis [ 16,22]. Each line of interview data
was open-coded, with codes iteratively grouped into themes. We
include illustrative quotes to ground each theme in expert insight
and summarise them in Table 1.
T1 - Ecological Authenticity and the Essence of Nature in
Building Design: Our analysis reveals the need to re-evaluate bio-
philic design philosophy [ 133] in contemporary building practices.
Experts critiqued the superficial adoption of biophilic design and
the tendency to treat nature as a static background (e.g. through
use of artificial plants), reducing it to aesthetic elements devoid of
362

ecological interaction or ecological value. One expert noted: "When
nature is treated as an object, we miss the opportunity to learn from
and collaborate with it, instead imposing our own limited under-
standing." Others raised concerns about building rating systems
likeWELL certifications5, arguing that they risk reducing biophilic
design to checklists, inadvertently fostering “green-washing”.
In exploring the essence of nature in building design, experts
highlighted a non-interventionist mindset for achieving ecological
authenticity (discussed further in section 6). The concept of “ third
landscapes ” where space expresses neither power nor submission to
power... " , inspired by Clément et al . [31] , was mentioned as a model
for enabling ecological processes to emerge naturally—designing
for conditions rather than dictating outcomes. One expert described
this as: "Instead of dictating (e.g. planting) designs, we should focus
on creating foundational conditions like soil and shade to let nature
respond and evolve." These reflections raise questions about the
role and representation of nature in design: What constitutes the
essence of nature in built environments, and how can we reconcile
its authenticity with the functional and experiential expectations
of intelligent indoor spaces, while respecting its authenticity?
T2 - Art as an Expression for Biophilic Experiences: Biophilic
art is well documented [ 15,89] in HCI through examples such as
robotic flowers [ 27] and vapour-based spatial partitions [ 34]. Ex-
perts highlighted (emerging) technology as an “artistic material
for extending natural behaviours” and enabling participatory de-
sign approaches. Biophilic art must embody “response” to reflect
nature’s essence (tying to the previous theme of ecological authen-
ticity): "...An important layer is reaction, so whenever a human does
something, the sensory nature experience reacts. So like grasses in a
landscape where you run through with your hand, and then lights
start to glow. It’s not natural in the way we know it, but it would
give, I think, a very natural response." Experts suggested that this
response could take the form of soft fascination —a quality that gen-
tly captures attention without overwhelming the mind (explored
in HCI [8, 106])—creating moments of distraction or relief.
Digitally mediated biophilic art can act as a participatory medium,
encouraging occupants to engage with and shape their surround-
ings, as well as develop emotional and cultural connections to
nature: "Artistic dimensions can mediate between human-made en-
vironments and natural inspirations, crafting spaces that resonate
emotionally with users." This could be through art that spatializes
human interaction with nature (e.g. [ 81]), such as interactive projec-
tions or augmented reality experiences [ 111]. Studio Roosegaarde’s
Waterlicht installation, which uses light and reflective lenses to sim-
ulate virtually flooded environments6, was shared as an example.
Crafting and 3D printing were highlighted as another participa-
tory medium for tying cultural narratives with nature. Iris van
Herpen’s Architectonics demonstrates coexistence between humans
and aquatic environments through future floating cities fashion7.
T3 - Biophilic Design for Ecological Empathy: Biophilic de-
sign holds the potential to foster ecological awareness and em-
pathy in urbanised societies where disconnection from nature is
growing [ 78,127]. Experts described how interactions with nature
5https://standard.wellcertified.com/well
6https://www.studioroosegaarde.net/project/waterlicht
7https://www.irisvanherpen.com/collections/architectonicsinfluence values like kindness and respect, encouraging empathic
behaviours. However, two limitations constrain current approaches.
First, raising awareness without cultivating a lasting commit-
ment to ecological preservation is insufficient. Experts suggested
integrating participatory stewardship, where individuals care for
natural elements to build a sense of responsibility. Central to this is
“cues for care” (previously put forth by Nassauer [93])—design that
signals value and the need for maintenance. One expert described
a project using QR codes and sensors to trigger pop-ups with in-
formation about nearby plants: "We’re adding a technical layer to
inform people about what is happening there...At [company name],
we wanted to create a sort of walking green route where once they’re
(employees) near a sensor, they get a pop-up about the plant or the
tree so they can learn more about it..."
Second, buildings fail to make invisible ecological processes
like species health or inter-species interaction perceivable to occu-
pants (e.g. the MicroAquarium installation that reveals live micro-
organism activity [ 76]). These interactions often unfold at temporal
scales that are not perceptible to humans, making them harder to
translate into meaningful interactions. Experts argued that making
such processes visible can reinforce a sense of interconnection:
"By designing buildings that show people how to coexist with other
species, we can remind users of their interconnectedness with the living
world." While indoor biotopes are a known strategy [ 69], experts
felt they often prioritise aesthetics over fostering curiosity and re-
flection. Such an emphasis limits the ability to inspire empathy and
a sustained commitment to preservation.
T4 - Multisensory and Multidimensional Biophilic Design:
In literature, we found that visual elements like greenery, views, and
patterns are common [ 9,77]. This visual focus has been critiqued,
notably by Pallasmaa in The Eyes of the Skin . Addressing this, one
expert remarked: "Using visual is an easier way to experience bio-
philia, and we found that most biophilic designs heavily relied on this
sense." While foundational, visual design alone fails to capture the
full richness of how humans interact with nature. Experts stressed
that nature inherently presents layered sensory experiences, such
as visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory, creating interactions that
are often absent indoors. The kinaesthetic sense—our awareness
of bodily movement—was emphasised. Experts spoke of designing
for kinaesthetic sense in two ways: movement (with)in nature (e.g.
flowing water, shifting light) and movement towards nature (e.g.
spatial layouts that invite exploration). One shared: "It’s not enough
to see trees through a window—design should invite people to go out,
move, and interact with the environment."
Experts described biophilic experiences as multidimensional, of-
fering three key experiential examples: First, nature operates on
varying scales , from the vastness of landscapes that inspire awe and
reflection, to the intimacy of small details that invite personal con-
nections. As one expert explained: "You are in contact with nature...
As humans, you start to reflect on your own ego and not really want
to control everything, and you feel a kind of relief. " Second, temporal
rhythms such as tides, light shifts, or seasonal cycles were also
viewed as essential yet rarely integrated indoors. One participant
reflected: "In nature, time is dynamic—you see tides coming in and
out, shadows shifting... There’s a rhythm to it that’s deeply tied to our

perception of being in nature." Finally, infinity was described as an-
other overlooked aspect: "Views of the horizon or infinite space—like
transparent designs or reflective surfaces—can create an illusion of
endlessness that connects users to the vastness of nature." .
T5 - Multi-species Flourishing in Buildings: Historically, ar-
chitecture has excluded or controlled non-human species—Vitruvius’
“primitive hut” [ 75,119] symbolises architecture’s functional origins,
prioritizing human protection and comfort. Modern practices often
perpetuate this trend through impermeable designs that hinder eco-
logical integration. Even within buildings that incorporate natural
elements, one expert noted: “Most of the time we get requested a
plant with hydro grains... the plant itself is in a hibernation state.
It’s surviving but not really actively doing anything.” In contrast,
multi-species flourishing considers buildings as opportunities for
ecological interaction and care between humans and non-humans.
This perspective informs design approaches suggested by experts.
First, embedding encounters with non-human species can foster
meaningful interactions. As one expert noted: "Creating spaces for
multi-species social encounters can encourage new experiences for
us.... and also shared use and mutual respect for the non-human."
Second, dedicated spaces for multi-species flourishing are essential.
While pollinator gardens [ 130] and insect hotels [ 60] are popular
outdoors, indoor spaces must support local life, including during
building off-hours. Connectivity is vital; transitional spaces like
ecological corridors [ 137] can link fragmented habitats, enabling
species and ecosystem interaction.
Technology was suggested in managing these interactions: "...a
smart cat door can open at certain times for a specific cat. You could
extend this to ecological passages... sometimes there may be too many
mice, so we close it or we try to balance between different ecological
communities. Technology could monitor and try to manage this rela-
tionship. " Finally, “Imagination” was highlighted as a critical design
tool (also discussed by Fernández et al . [39] ):"Imagination allows us
to see beyond functional limitations and engage with the possibilities
of truly integrated ecological systems." .T6 - Biophilic Design for Social Justice: Two experts raised
the potential of biophilic design as a means of addressing social
inequities by fostering inclusive, community-focused environments.
Research supports this premise—nature and affluence are linked
in urban settings, where areas with abundant greenery tend to
be wealthier, while under-resourced areas often lack access to na-
ture [ 134]. This disparity extends to indoor spaces as well: “Biophilic
design is frequently seen as a luxury, rarely accessible to those who
might benefit most from it.” We saw that most biophilic projects
mentioned by experts, whether from their own work or known
examples, were heavily concentrated in corporate developments.
Despite this, biophilic design can support marginalised commu-
nities by combining ecological stewardship with social inclusiv-
ity [97]. First, it can foster a sense of ownership through partic-
ipatory design, where collaborative biophilic projects bridge gaps
between professional intent and the lived experiences of diverse
users. Such projects can promote economic uplift by integrating
urban agriculture or green infrastructure, providing community
resources and ecological benefits. Second, biophilic design can help
meet the emotional and social needs of transient or vulnerable
populations by creating spaces that provide refuge and healing
(also shown in existing works [ 29,118]). Experts emphasised pro-
gramming to keep such spaces active and inclusive. As one noted,
“Programming ensures that these spaces don’t just exist as beautiful
designs but are used. It’s like creating a modern version of a church—a
space for community and solace.”
In literature, in ancient temple courtyards, biophilia served col-
lective and inclusive functions [ 49]. The industrial era, however,
shifted design priorities toward efficiency and density, often at the
cost of natural elements. While biophilic design is re-emerging as a
response to ecological and social challenges, its implementation of-
ten reflects existing inequalities. In corporate settings, it manifests
as immersive features like indoor ponds; in underserved contexts, it
is reduced to token greenery. Reclaiming biophilic design’s commu-
nal, inclusive legacy may help address these disparities and ensure
its benefits reach those who need them most.

Designing Multisensory Biophilic Futures DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
T7 - The Body in Biophilic Design: The human body is central
to biophilic design—as both observer and participant, it senses and
responds to environmental cues: "...the human body—as a natural
sensor... it’s the first means we can use to recreate our inner connection
with nature." This view builds on Shusterman [112] , where bodily
scale and orientation guide spatial design. Somaesthetic design in
HCI extends this perspective, highlighting bodily awareness and
the reciprocal relationship between body and environment[ 57,58].
Body sensitivity emerged as a critical design principle, advocat-
ing for delicate, nuanced interactions with natural elements, like
moss textures or rustling leaves, to foster deep somatic connec-
tions. Sensitivity was framed through a feminist lens, addressing
gendered differences in somatic needs. Experts discussed how hor-
monal cycles and bodily rhythms influence indoor experiences (also
researched in gender studies [ 52,72]), and how buildings should
respond to these differences. Technology was offered as a means
to respond to feminist bodily needs: "And in an ideal building, it is
more related to how our body works and how we feel and how we can
be the most happy and productive in that sense. And then technology
could analyse your body—body temperature, for example. So for a
woman’s body, where are you in your cycle? What do you need?" .
Another highlighted the importance of augmenting this sensitivity
to make biophilic experiences accessible: "You need to be sensitive to
first catch the different benefits a biophilic experience can offer. And
we have seen that the female body is more sensitive..." . We discuss
this in greater detail in section 6.
Bodily awareness, biophilia, and architecture were also discussed
through what one expert termed the “living effect” (briefly explored
in HCI [ 116]), highlighting elements that evoke growth and vitality
in artificial spaces. This idea extends to the concept of bodily flow ,
where design elements such as meandering paths or kinetic instal-
lations not only encourage physical movement but also create an
awareness of the interaction between the body and its surround-
ings [ 25,112]. By actively guiding movement, such designs enable
occupants to experience spaces in a way that feels organic and
intuitive, enhancing their connection to both the environment and
their own embodied presence. The somatic-biophilic lens thus of-
fers an alternative lens on how biophilic design can support deeper
connection to nature and self.
T8 - Biophilic Design for Occupant (Dis)Comfort: Experts
highlighted that biophilic design should challenge traditional com-
fort norms: "Comfort should not always about ease; sometimes it’s
about engagement. And I think that nature’s unpredictability makes
us feel alive, even when it’s inconvenient." In smart buildings, for
example, sunlight enriches sensory experiences with light and
shadow (called Komorebi [ 138]), but is often “corrected” through
automated shading systems [ 24]. Similarly, natural elements per-
ceived as “messy” or unpredictable are frequently avoided: "People
think it’s (referring to a landscape project) very messy, and they are
reluctant to interact with the space. But sanitised versions limit and
reduce our connection to the natural world."
In nature, discomfort is often experienced as duality . Walking
barefoot on sand can be grounding, yet painful (e.g. from sharp
shells). One expert reflected: "...I am really enjoying being in nature
but it could also a lot of time be a bit scary, bring fear...like innate
fear when you are confronting with nature." Yet, these moments ofdiscomfort can catalyse personal reflection: "Friction fosters reflec-
tion. When we’re uncomfortable, we’re more likely to pay attention
and find meaning in our surroundings. A lot of new reflection actu-
ally comes from this friction in contact with nature." This tension
between comfort and discomfort seems inevitable. Designing for
biophilic (dis)comfort could involve strategic oscillations between
ease and challenge, mimicking natural rhythms: "The stepping stones
(installed in the midst of a footpath) reduce paving...you really have
to watch your step, but you feel like you’re passing through a natural
overgrown area." Discomfort could also be framed as a trade-off,
where users accept minor inconveniences—such as insects from
pollinator plants indoors—for greater ecological benefits. This is
discussed in section 6.
In productivity-focused spaces, biophilic (dis)comfort raises crit-
ical questions of balance and appropriateness. While greenery and
lighting enhance focus (e.g. [ 4]), one expert noted: "There’s an ap-
petite for more greenery, especially after the pandemic, to try to make
sure that the spaces indoors actually do have the qualities that are a
bit more, let’s say, friendly and encourage people to come back and
work. " How can (dis)comfort align with expectations in workplaces
or learning environments? Finally, limiting design to ableist bodies
is problematic. Overly wild, unpredictable elements may be inac-
cessible to individuals with mobility or sensory sensitivities: "you
need to see if everything is accessible. You could have parts like that
(referring to a project that designed for exploratory pathways paved
with stones) but it needs to be wheelchair accessible. Otherwise, it can
limit (someone’s) movements." .
6 Design Opportunities for Multisensory &
Multidimensional Biophilic Interactions
We next synthesised Topics (TO1–TO7) and Themes (T1-T8) into
five actionable design directions (DO1–DO5). We also explore how
emerging technologies can reimagine biophilic experiences in smart
environments, summarised in Table 2. Although technology was
not the primary focus of our interviews, experts highlighted its
potential, particularly in themes related to art (T2), multi-species
coexistence (T5), and embodied experiences (T7) (c.f. section 4). We
used these discussions to support our design opportunities with
technology enablers.
DO1: Designing for Emergent Natural Processes .To foster
deeper connection with nature, smart buildings must support evolv-
ing, self-regulating, and unpredictable qualities inherent in natural
processes (see section 5). Unlike mechanical systems with repetitive
patterns, natural processes evolve unpredictably, creating emergent
properties—where small changes lead to transformative shifts [ 31].
For example, ecosystems may adapt to support new species or be-
haviours, reflecting nature’s novelty and resilience [ 23,100]. Design-
ing with this quality means embracing flux and variability—qualities
rarely integrated into current smart building design (e.g. Economi-
dou[37]’s vision of moving walls and talking floors). For IxD, this
prompts the development of tools and methods that foreground
emergence and unpredictability. For smart building researchers,
it suggests investigating how such features influence occupants’
comfort and emotional responses.
Realising emergent processes in smart buildings calls for tech-
nologies that enable unpredictability and self-regulation [ 31]. This

Theme Description Example Codes (n=3) Count
T1 - Ecological Authenticity and
the Essence of Nature in Building
DesignThis theme revisits the philosophy of biophilic design as a deep, au-
thentic connection with nature that aligns with its processes, patterns,
and non-human agency. However, this philosophy is often diluted
or lost in translation during the design process, leading to tokenistic
or anthropocentric implementations. The focus is on preserving the
integrity of ecosystems by designing in harmony with their natural
cycles rather than imposing human-centred control.Shallow adoption and To-
kenism; Re-framing Nature

plified perceptions of nature75
T2 - Art as an Expression for Bio-

nature through artistic expression. It discusses how art and technology
can combine to enable biophilic experiences to create participatory,
restorative, and culturally resonant designs.Technology as participatory

T3 - Biophilic Design for Ecological
EmpathyBiophilic design emerges as a medium for fostering environmental
awareness, ecological empathy, and sustainable behaviours. By in-
tegrating biophilic principles into design, spaces can support active
learning, encouraging a sense of stewardship and collective responsi-
bility for the natural world. This theme emphasises how educational
biophilia—using interactive, sensory, and participatory approaches—
can cultivate biophilic behaviours in occupants.Nature awareness as a cata-
lyst for nature respect; Par-

ture; Technology for ampli-
fying living elements52

where diverse species can coexist, thrive, and contribute to ecological
resilience. It emphasises the agency of non-human species as active
building “occupants”. The focus is on creating opportunities for non-
human species to express their natural behaviours, flourish in human-
altered spaces, and contribute to shared ecosystems.Living ecosystem design

T6 - Biophilic Design for Social Jus-
ticeThis theme examines biophilic design for social inequities by fostering
inclusive, participatory, and community-focused environments. It cri-
tiques the exclusivity of biophilic design as a “corporate culture” and
advocates for equitable access to natural, restorative spaces. The focus
is on empowering marginalised and vulnerable communities through
designs that provide safe spaces for emotional escape and support

T7 - The Body in Biophilic Design This theme explores the role of the human body as a site of interac-
tion and perception within biophilic design. Drawing on somaesthetic
principles in built environments, which emphasise bodily awareness,
sensory engagement, and movement [ 112], this theme explores how
somaesthetic design can provide an alternative lens to can foster mean-
ingful biophilic experiences, fostering awareness of nature, and of self.Human body as a sensor for

(Dis)ComfortThis theme challenges traditional notions of comfort by creating envi-
ronments that evoke both comfort and discomfort. It examines how
embracing elements of discomfort including unpredictability and even
fear can be a meaningful aspect of the nature experience within in-
door spaces. By embracing these “unexpected” aspects of nature, this
theme examines the opportunities and challenges around designing
for biophilic (dis)comfort as a means for connecting with nature.Friction in contact with na-

could involve repurposing the idea of “third landscapes”—unmanaged,
dedicated indoor areas where technology supports natural pro-
cesses [ 31].Stochastic algorithms in IoT systems might trigger en-
vironmental changes within probabilistic bounds, such as fluctu-
ating light or airflow that reflects external wind variability [ 65].
Generative AI could create evolving soundscapes in response toreal-time environmental data—like wind speed, temperature, or
occupancy, mirroring natural acoustic dynamism [ 13,98].Collab-
orative AI ecosystems [74] might coordinate lighting, shading, or
HVAC systems to behave in interdependent, temporally unfolding
behaviours, generating a living quality within the building—similar
to explorations in computational architecture [129].

DO2: Designing for Occupant Body Sensitivity .This oppor-
tunity positions the human body as an interface and an active
participant in biophilic experiences. By encouraging occupants to
notice, understand, and reflect on their embodied sensations, build-
ings can foster deeper connections to the surrounding biophilic
conditions (c.f. Theme 7, section 5). For IxD, this opportunity chal-
lenges the prevailing paradigm of uniform sensory experiences in
smart buildings, supporting first-person, body-centred interactions
with biophilic conditions.
Building on embodied urban HCI [ 44], technologies could am-
plify bodily awareness of ambient, subtle biophilic cues [ 121]. Hap-
tic or thermal wearables can translate airflow or temperature into
tactile feedback. For instance, a wearable might vibrate or warm
slightly to guide users to align themselves with airflow patterns in a
room, encouraging a restorative state [ 106].Smart building façades
could act as interactive sensory mediators [102, 115], responding to
environmental changes such as “sweating” on hot days or during
higher humidity levels before rain, connecting them with natu-
ral phenomena. Augmented Reality (AR) can visualise real-time
physiological data, such as heart rate or breathing, overlaying this
information onto the user’s environment (similar to using AR for
visualising indoor air pollution [ 61]). An interface could, for in-
stance, illustrate how proximity to plants or exposure to natural
light impacts physiological responses, enabling reflection through
a biophilic lens. Finally, digital journaling tools like “biophilic body
maps” could incorporate feminist and inclusive perspectives by
allowing users to document and share how their identities and
contexts shape their interactions with biophilic elements [ 123]. Ag-
gregated body maps data from multiple users could reveal how
groups engage with biophilic spaces, offering input for designing
communal environments for maximising biophilic interactions.
DO3: Designing for Biophilic (Dis)Comfort .Smart buildings
should incorporate moments of (dis)comfort to deepen human con-
nections to nature (c.f. Theme 8, section 5). By integrating fric-
tional design elements inspired by biophilic surroundings [ 11],
IxD can create experiences that deliberately use discomfort to
provoke reflection and inspire new understandings of the natu-
ral world [99, 102].
IoT-enabled technology in flooring systems could simulate tactile
interactions by subtly cracking or shifting underfoot (e.g. Econo-
midou [37]’s moving floors), symbolising ecosystem fragility and
prompting occupants to reflect on climate impact. These might be
augmented with ambient soundscapes, like the cracking of brittle
surfaces to highlight ecosystem fragility [ 7]. We previously dis-
cussed biophilic (dis)comfort as a trade-off , where occupants accept
minor inconveniences for greater ecological or experiential benefits.
Buildings could provide context for discomfort-inducing features,
helping occupants interpret their experiences. For instance, AR
overlays visualise indoor pollinator corridors with representations
of bees or butterflies, paired with subtle sensory cues like vibra-
tions or ambient buzzing sounds, encouraging reflection on shared
habitats [ 84]. Discomfort could extend to experiences of risk and
discernment . As one expert noted, "Taste is a sense of caution... even
in nature, we exercise a certain judgment." Interactive installations
could explore this cautious quality through scent or visual provo-
cations that elicit hesitation and curiosity, prompting reflection onsensory boundaries (e.g. risk expressing design [ 36]). In workspaces,
designers could introduce “productive biophilic discomfort” [3]. For
instance, smart lighting systems in light-scarce regions might dim
briefly, mimicking cloud cover. While this momentary discomfort
could disrupt focus, prompting occupants to seek natural light.
DO4: Designing for Biophilic Equity .Through biophilic eq-
uity, smart buildings can address the systemic disparities in access
to nature experiences and their benefits in indoor spaces, which has
often been uneven (c.f. Themes 2 and 6, section 5). This necessitates
prioritising public buildings and shared urban environments for
biophilic design. For IxD and smart building researchers, biophilic
equity offers opportunities to tackle the inequities through partici-
patory technologies, therapeutic tools, and cultural storytelling.
One potential application is digital platforms for participatory de-
sign[6]. Interactive apps or web platforms could enable community
members to actively contribute to shaping biophilic spaces [ 6,47].
For instance, users could suggest plant species, vote on design fea-
tures, or provide input that reflects their cultural and ecological val-
ues.Biophilic connection technologies could also serve as therapeutic
tools for marginalised groups such as displaced refugees or at-risk
youth. Immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences could transport
users to calming, nature-rich environments such as forests or ocean
providing solace amidst hardships. Digital storytelling through ar-
chitectural features [ 21] in community centres or youth facilities
could host interactive art installations or digital projections that
celebrate the cultural and ecological histories of under-represented
groups (like the co-design with displaced youth [ 41] to develop
wayfaring solutions). For example, public spaces could visualise
the biodiversity of regions associated with displaced communi-
ties, fostering a shared ecological narrative and recognising their
contributions to environmental stewardship.
DO5 - Designing for Relational Encounters with Nature .
Smart buildings foster relational encounters by encouraging em-
pathy, care, and mutual growth between humans and nature (c.f.
Themes T3, T1, T5, section 5). It makes nature’s needs visible to
promote awareness and responsibility [ 42,78]. Historical exam-
ples of Persian gardens embodied this by requiring active care
from humans who maintained irrigation systems, creating ecosys-
tems that rewarded engagement with fruit-bearing trees [ 70,71].
For researchers, designing for relational encounters with nature
opens pathways for technologies fostering individual and collec-
tive empathy. It also calls for studying how group dynamics shape
engagement within biophilic spaces.
Relational encounters with nature can be fostered by “surfacing”
the presence and processes of ecological systems [ 42,78,116]. This
includes “cues for care” inviting reflection (discussed in T3 section 5).
Drawing from technology design in Relational-Cultural Theory
(RCT) [ 32,73,132], IoT sensors, for example, can track soil or light
and translate data into interactive cues. For example, projection walls
and ambient displays could show environmental changes in shared
spaces like lobbies or meeting rooms, supporting shared group
responses to support biophilic elements [ 82].Empathy-building
technologies could further enhance relational encounters by shift-
ing perspectives from human to non-human [ 42]. AR, for example,
might simulate a “plant’s-eye view” of human actions [ 120], show-
ing how behaviours like touching or crowding impact growth and

7 Discussion of Findings: Implications For
Smart Building Research
Our findings include seven topics (T1-T7) , eight themes (T1-T8) , and
fivedesign opportunities (DO1-DO5) . While topics served as an organ-
ising scaffold, here we focus on how the themes andopportunities ex-
tend HBI research: thematically , by expanding the experiential and
ecological vocabulary of interaction, and generatively , by proposing
new design directions and technological opportunities. We then
share messages for a multisensory–multidimensional (MS–MD)
approach to biophilic interaction. Finally, we discuss tensions in
applying biophilic design and study limitations.
7.1 Thematic Contributions: Expanding the
Vocabulary of HBI
Our findings contribute to HBI by expanding its design vocabulary—
re-framing smart buildings as ecological interfaces that surface nat-
ural rhythms and multispecies presence (T1, T3, T5) . While prior
HBI work has largely prioritised comfort and behavioural con-
trol [ 2,95], ecological awareness and more-than-human perspec-
tives remain under-explored. Through our themes, we surface terms
such as multispecies flourishing ,biophilic (dis)comfort , and ecological
interface to capture this shift. Second, we foreground multisensory,
somatic engagement in interaction design. Experts envisioned sys-
tems that respond to the body through movement, rhythm, andmaterial sensitivity—beyond visual dashboards or app-based feed-
back (T2, T4, T7, T8) . While soma design has highlighted embodied
experience in HCI [ 58], our findings extend these insights into archi-
tectural space, suggesting how buildings themselves may become
expressive, responsive participants in biophilic interaction. Finally,
our themes emphasise the social and cultural responsibility of smart
environments. Although HBI has begun to address equity and pri-
vacy [ 90], it often overlooks how cultural values, neurodiversity,
and uneven access to nature shape lived experience. Biophilic de-
sign offers a way to support diverse bodies, histories, and sensory
needs—enabling justice-oriented smart environments [28].
7.2 Generative Opportunities: Biophilic
Interaction Through Technology
Our design opportunities contribute to HBI by reimagining how
technology can support biophilic interaction. These contributions
open new conceptual and material directions for IxD in the built
environment. First, we reposition sensing from a behavioural op-
timisation [ 26] mechanism to a medium for ecological expression.
Speculative deployments of stochastic IoT and generative AI render
light, sound, and air movement as expressive materials—carrying
the rhythms of weather, growth, or animal migration (DO1, DO5) .
This extends sensing beyond data extraction into ambient ecologi-
cal storytelling. Second, shifting from traditional HCI perspectives,
we build on soma design to propose embodied interactions at archi-
tectural scale . Haptic panels, responsive facades, and AR overlays
attuned to movement and physiology foster bodily and interpretive
engagement with biophilic environments (DO2) . These approaches
challenge the dominance of reactive, screen-based interfaces in
368

smart building design [ 102,122]. Third, we envision participatory
and justice-oriented directions for HBI. Our opportunities include
VR platforms for community co-design and systems that regis-
ter non-human presence—such as pollinators or wildlife corridors
(DO3, DO4, DO5) . These interactions extend critical HCI into ar-
chitectural contexts [ 56], positioning smart buildings as spaces of
care, activism, and more-than-human coexistence.
7.3 Reflective Messages for Multi-sensory and
Multi-dimensional Biophilic Interaction in
HBI
Smart buildings must evolve to support richer, more ecologically
attuned forms of interaction, aligned with a multisensory - multidi-
mensional (MS–MD) approach. To support this reorientation, we
distil five reflective messages by reflecting on the combined study
findings, intended to guide future HBI design and research. First,
biophilic interaction should be scaled across different perceptual
levels —from micro (e.g. tactile encounters through fingertips), to
meso (e.g. room-scale soundscapes or kinetic partitions), to macro
(e.g. building-wide lighting systems reflecting outdoor conditions).
Second, building on this multi-scale sensitivity, interactions should
unfold temporally , allowing environments to act as narrative spaces
shaped by seasonal rhythms and lived memory. Third, biophilic sys-
tems should strive for coherence across sensory modalities, so that
light, sound, temperature, and motion collectively evoke ecological
meaning rather than functioning as disconnected features. Fourth,
well-timed “disruptions” or moments of surprise can play a powerful
role—fostering curiosity, reflection, and deeper connection to place
and self. Finally, biophilic interaction must remain inclusive , de-
signed with sensitivity to diverse bodies, access needs, and cultural
ways of sensing and being. Together, these messages reframe bio-
philic interaction as interpretive (inviting meaning-making) rather
than prescriptive (dictating responses), and reciprocal rather than
extractive—qualities that are critical as HBI moves toward more-
than-human, justice-oriented futures.
7.4 Discussion of Biophilic Interaction Design
Tensions
The opportunities outlined in this paper highlight a critical tension
between technological advancement and the intrinsic, cultural, and
emotional values of nature [ 48]. This “technocratic fallacy” reflects
the risk of framing biophilic design through an overly technical lens.
Such framings may prioritise quantifiable metrics, such as run-time
efficiency of IoT systems managing building conditions, side-lining
the intrinsic qualities of nature that evoke awe, connection, and
belonging. Detached, technical discourse can further disconnect
occupants from the authentic and restorative qualities of nature. We
need to remain mindful of such framings and ensure technological
solutions complement the humanistic and ecological principles of
biophilia [66, 68, 133].
Biophilic design also entails a reciprocal relationship. One side
concerns humans benefiting from nature—through sensory stim-
ulation and well-being; the other involves nature benefiting from
us—through care, stewardship, and infrastructural support. Expert
visions largely focused on the former, envisioning how smart build-
ings might enhance human experience. This human-centred focusmirrors a broader gap in HBI, where technologies often overlook
ecological reciprocity. Yet in the face of climate change, biodiversity
loss, and environmental degradation, reciprocity is essential. Smart
buildings are not passive—they reshape ecosystems, consume re-
sources, and produce waste. They must therefore be designed not
only to evoke nature, but to sustain it. Moving forward, we call for
biophilic design in HBI to be critically reoriented toward ecological
responsibility and care for more-than-human life.
7.5 Discussion of Limitations and Future Work
This work reflects our positional lens as researchers working across
HCI, architecture, and interaction design, and is not without limita-
tions. First, most experts were European, and their imaginaries may
not reflect broader societal, Indigenous perspectives on biophilic
interaction. While we observed disciplinary differences—such as
technical versus aesthetic framings—most experts shared a design-
forward orientation, potentially skewing the findings toward cer-
tain types of interventions. Some offered perspectives in social
justice or spirituality, but these remained peripheral. As one noted:
"European architecture focuses on buildings for human design—a lot
of this comes from the dominance of Christianity, which emphasised
actions in favour of humankind. This contrasts with the perspectives
of say the Indigenous tribes in Australia... " . Future work should inten-
tionally engage more diverse world-views and situated knowledge.
Second, we chose to conduct interviews over scoping or system-
atic literature reviews. We find that interviews allowed us to cap-
ture tacit knowledge, practice-based reflections, and design imag-
inaries that may not yet be documented in academic discourse.
Moreover, the initial coding was conducted by a single author. Al-
though findings were iteratively discussed and refined, this may
introduce subjective emphasis. Future work could extend our inter-
view data with methods—such as co-design, literature reviews, or
in-situ prototyping—to broaden empirical grounding. Finally, the
technological examples linked to our design opportunities were
interpretively developed. Although not discussed directly in inter-
views, we drew on our disciplinary expertise to propose plausi-
ble interventions—such as generative AI and ecological sensors—
chosen for their conceptual resonance with the experiential quali-
ties described by experts. We offer these as illustrative pathways
to expand the HBI design space, and we invite future research to
adapt, extend, or critically examine these interventions through
prototyping and participatory methods.
8 Conclusion
This study set out to gather expert ideas, considerations, and imag-
inaries around the potential for biophilic experiences in buildings.
Our goal was to identify opportunities for inspiring the future
design of smart buildings that move past addressing occupants’
physical comfort and consider the role of these buildings within
larger ecological systems. Our work contributes to the growing
discourse on integrating biophilic principles into smart building
design. By bridging the legacy of biophilic architecture with emerg-
ing technologies, we aim to inspire research and practice that goes
beyond functionality to include the ecological, cultural, and sensory
dimensions of human experience through biophilic smart buildings
for human and ecological flourishing.

A Semi-Structured Interview
A.1 Outline of Questions
Here we provide an outline of the interview questions used. Within
each interview topic (e.g. Introduction), we show examples of some
of the different questions that were asked based on the nature of the
conversation. Given the semi-structured nature, we did not adhere
to the sequence of these questions within each topic.
A.1.1 Introduction. Briefly introduce the study’s focus on multi-
sensory biophilic design within smart buildings highlighting the
interest in MSB around.
(1)Could you share your background in (relevant text)—particularly
regarding your experience with biophilic design?
(2)Interpretation of Connection: When people talk about this
goal for design that allows “a deeper connection to nature”
in built environments, what do you think that means?
(3)How does this resonate with your experiences or design
philosophy?
(4)(give context on smart environments) What are your thoughts
on integrating biophilic elements within smart environments?

A.1.2 Grounded Insights. Explore the practical and technical as-
pects, identifying research-based perspectives, technical insights,
criticisms, and relevant examples in MSB design.
(1)Existing Design Limitations: (...our desk research shows...)
Current biophilic designs are often visually focused (e.g. use
of lights, living walls, nature-inspired privacy screens, green
colours). Do you agree, and why do you think that is the
case?
(2)Sensory Engagement: Which sensory elements (e.g. smell,
texture, sounds, even vibrations) do you think could be most
effective in creating a sense of immersion or connection to
nature within built environments?
A.1.3 Challenges and Feasibility.
(1)What [technical] challenges do you anticipate when design-
ing multi-sensory biophilic spaces, such as those incorporat-
ing sound, touch, or scent? (depending on the background -
focus on either future material possibilities, future concepts,
or technology)
(2)Speculating on Future Biophilic Technologies: Are there any
emerging technologies or materials that you think could en-
hance multi-sensory biophilic design? How might these help
create environments that are more ‘alive’ and responsive?
(3)Criticisms: Are there any problems you have with the way
we consider nature design in its current applications?
A.1.4 Experiential Perspectives. Gather insights on personal ex-
periences, professional values, and context-specific knowledge re-
garding MSB design.
(1)Body-Nature Connection: Can you share an experience or
a project where a built environment made you feel deeply
connected to nature? Which aspects were most impactful?
(2)Multi-sensory: Similarly, are there any specific projects you’ve
worked on or encountered that successfully engaged multi-
ple senses? Do you remember what impact it had on you?(3)Values and Priorities: What core values (e.g. peace, healing,
diversity) do you think should shape the design of a MSB
space?
A.1.5 Visionary Outlooks. Encourage exploration of future visions
and speculate on potential evolutions in MSB design.
(1)Exploring Enhancement Possibilities: “If you could enhance
one sensory aspect of biophilic design in current spaces,
what would it be, and how do you imagine it might affect
occupants’ experiences?”
(2)Speculative Scenarios: “Picture a future environment that
seamlessly blends technology with natural elements—for
instance, a space that feels like it ‘breathes’ (inhales and
exhales). Are there any such forward-thinking or aspirational
concepts you’ve come across—or envisioned yourself—that
could inform the future of multi-sensory environments?
(3)Future Visions: If you could design a biophilic environment
that integrates various sensory responses to create a deep
connection with nature, what would this look and feel like?
A.1.6 Conclusion and Reflection. Wrap up with open reflection
and any additional thoughts.
(1)Do you see biophilic design gaining more importance in the
future where spaces are increasingly smart?
(2)What role do you see for architects/designers in shaping
these sensory-rich, adaptive spaces?
(3)Finally, could you share a source of inspiration for multi-
sensory biophilic design—a book, movie, place, piece of art,
or any other experience that has influenced your thinking
in this area? Any additional thoughts or anything else that
you would like to mention?
