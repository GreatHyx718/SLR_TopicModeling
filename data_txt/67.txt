 Abstract:  
This study analyze d the impact of generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems on 
contemporary AI -based art  generation  practices. As algorithms display nascent creativity, 
they catalyze philosophical questions regarding the role of technology in artistic creation.  
However, the influence of AI on art creation, perception, and consumption remains 
unexplored by empirical research.  
This analysis integrates the theoretical frameworks of post -phenomenology and actor -
network theory to investigate how generative AI technologies mediate creators’ perception, 
agency, and imagination.  It explores  how human -algorithm assemblages may expand 
possibilities while also obscuring  the anthropocentric constructs underpinning art.  It uses 
Netnography to  explore  artistic communities that interact with the R eddit website to 
illustrate the  tensions arising as human rationalities and intentions collide wi th algorithmic 
logics and constraints. The results reveal generative AI’s potential to delegate intentionality 
as well as its potential influence on agency, rationality, and memory.  Using empirical 
grounding, this study elucidates the complex entanglements among artists, algorithms, 
artwork, and the public in the emerging generative AI terrain.

Introduction  
Generative artificial intelligence ( GAI) has emerged as a powerful creative tool in the field 
of art creation, transforming traditional artistic processes and expanding the boundaries of 
creative expression. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and neural networks, GAI 
systems can generate novel and unique artworks autonomously or in collaboration with 
human artists  (Busch, 2023; Galanter, 2016; Koerner, 2023) . GAI fuses generative  poesis 
with automated praxis within iterative computational systems. It is a type of art creation 
that does not divide poesis from praxis and embodies a n almost  pure r elational, algorithmic 
form of art creation.  Amalgamation of generative and applied functions within iterative 
computational systems that function as an  ideal candidate for posthuman art form  (Sorgner, 
2022) . Yet, questions regarding its influence on art creation and art perception, and 
 
3 
 consumption remain unanswered by empirical research (Chatterjee, 2022) . As generative 
AI becomes further enmeshed within artistic creation processes, a multifaceted question 
crystallizes: can emerging human -algorithm collaborations meaningfully augment creative 
possibilities without imposing restrictive computational rationali ties or eroding 
fundamental facets of artistic agency?  
There is a significant amount of technical and philosophical literature on GAI, yet 
empirical research validating hypotheses and claims in the context of human -machine 
interaction remains scarce, and actual perceptional changes remain unknown.  While 
theoretical discussions offer valuable insights, empirical studies are essential for bridging 
the gap between speculation and tangible evidence. Conducting rigorous empirical 
research can provide concrete insights into the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral 
dimensions of human engagement with GAI artwork. This approach can enrich our 
understanding, empower artists and researchers, and foster a deeper appreciation of the 
interplay between human creativity and the transformative potential of GAI systems 
(Galanter, 2016) . 
Generative AI and Art Creation  
Generative AI refers to a branch of AI that focuses on creating systems capable of 
producing original and creative output. In the context of art creation, GAI algorithms can 
generate images, music, poetry, and other artistic forms, often based on large datasets and 
predefined rules or patterns. The use of GAI in art offers new opportunities for artists to 
explore unconventional approaches, generate diverse ideas, and push the boundaries of 
their creative practice (Gonzalez, 2020; Mazzone & Elgammal, 2019; Pošćić & Kreković, 
2020) . 
This study's critical analysis of the impact of GAI on art creation engages key posthumanist 
debates.  It questions liberal humanist assumptions about the privileged position of the 
human subject  in light of technology's growing capacities (Hayles, 1999; Sorgner, 2010; 
Wolfe, 2010) . This research elucidates the complex networks binding artists, algorithms, 
artwork, and the public  by applying post -phenomenological and ANT  (actor -network 
theory)  frameworks (Coeckelbergh, 2020; Latour, 2005; Verbeek, 2005) . In centering 
tensions between human and algorithmic agencies, imaginations, and memories, this study 
 
4 
 underscores ambiguities in AI's creative roles, aligning with posthumanism’s nuanced 
negotiation between progress and preservation (Braidotti, 2013) .  
The Role of AI  affordances  in Expanding Artistic Possibilities  
GAI has opened  new avenues for artistic experimentation and exploration. AI systems can 
generate complex and intricate artwork that may be impractical or time -consuming for 
human artists to create manually.  This technological innovation enables artists to transcend 
the limitations of their own skills and knowledge, resulting in novel artistic expressions 
(Zammit et al., 2022) . Moreover, GAI algorithms can learn from existing artistic styles and 
genres, allowing artists to seamlessly merge and reinterpret various influences on their 
work (Elgammal et al., 2017) . How does this technology influence art and its creation?  
Theories focusing on technological  mediation may provide a valuable lens for 
interpretation.  
Post-Phenomenolog y and the Technical Mediation of Art 
A new generation of technology philosophers, including Latour (1992) , Ihde (1979, 1990) , 
and Mitcham (1994) , critiqued earlier thinkers to espouse a narrow, dystopian view of 
technology as an autonomous force that enframes and diminishes human agency.  
Specifically, they argue that their predecessors, scholars such as Ellul (1954/2011) , 
Heidegger (1953/2008) , and Jaspers (1957)  have portrayed technology as a monolithic, 
deterministic phenomenon completely separate from society that presents inherent threats 
to human meaning and freedom.  In contrast, Latour, Ihde and others focused on the role of 
technology as a mediator, building and shaping the relationship between human users and 
the wider environment, depending on use, context, and meaning (Coeckelbergh, 2013, p. 
41; Feenberg, 2005; Ihde, 2009) . 
The French philosopher, Bruno Latour focus ed on the role of technology in mediating 
human -world interactions , recogniz ing that technology shape s human experiences and 
perceptions, becoming an inseparable part of human existence  and forming a network of 
human and nonhuman actors  (or actants)  (Latour, 2005) . Latour’s framework explains 
technical mediation through a network of interlinking mediation relations of translation, 
composition, and delegation. This paper leverages Latour’s notion of delegation, wherein 
one agent’s intentions are delegated across a network binding artists (human actors), 
 
5 
 algorithms (non -human actors), companies, and consumers (Latour, 1999, pp. 183 –185). 
Latour also advanced the metaphor of “opening the black box” regarding the inner 
complexity of technological artifacts, emphasizing the need to peer inside and unpack 
sociotechnical associations producing system effects rather than seeing technologies as 
monolithic external forces (Latour, 1994, pp. 31 –40).  
Specifically, I used his approach to explore how artistic intentions are delegated to GAI 
systems , which then reshape the outputs as nonhuman actants imposing their own 
computational logics . Following this network of mediation reveal s complex entanglements 
between artist intentionality, algorithmic processes,  and final a rtistic “ products .” 
Don Ihde's post -phenomenological approach emphasizes the human experience of 
technological mediation and how it influences human actions , perception s, and 
interpretation s of the world (Ihde, 1990, 2009) . Ihde’s work differentiates  between micro 
and macro perceptions  to explore  the ways in which human perception is shaped by 
technology and the environment. Micro perception refers to the immediate sensorial 
experience of the world, where our senses are attuned to specific stimuli.  For example, 
microscopes extend our micro perception by allowing us to focus on and magnify specific 
aspects of our environment, thus contributing to changes in macro perceptions.  Macro 
perception refers to a broader, contextual understanding of the world, considering  the larger 
systems, structures, and meanings at play. Ihde emphasizes the exploration of both micro 
and macro perceptions to gain a comprehensive understanding of our lived experiences and 
the ways in which technology mediates our perception of the world . Applied  to our context 
of GAI and art creation, Ihde's framework enables an exploration of how artists' embodied 
interactions with GAI systems impact their artistic expressions, aesthetics, and overall art 
experience s, as well as  the macro perception of how art and its creators  change  as a result 
of GAI interaction .  
Both theories might offer us a valuable lens for interpretation, but they cannot be 
considered empirical  as methodologies for empirical works (Latour, 1996; Nimmo, 2011) . 
To fill this gap, the present study employed netnography and applied post -
phenomenological theories to the analysis of Reddit forums and the experiences shared by 
users.

 Methodology  
The present study employed  netnographical research on four specific communities on 
Reddit (subreddits): r/blender1, r/artistlounge2, r/StableDiffusion3, and r/dalle24, to gather 
data and insights relevant to the effects of GAI on art creation. These subreddits were 
selected based on their active user engagement, diversity of artistic practices, and relevance 
to the research topic.  By targeting these speciali zed communities, this study aims to capture 
rich and diverse perspectives from artists, animators, and enthusiasts who are actively 
involved in utilizing GAI tools within the context of art creation  . 
Netnography  
Netnography, as a qualitative research methodology, was employed to investigate the 
effects of using GAI on art creation.  Netnography is a type of qualitative social media 
research.  It adapts the methods of ethnography to understand social interactions in 
contemporary digital communication s contexts.  Netnography is a specific set of research 
practices related to data collection, analysis, research ethics, and representation, rooted in 
participant observation. In netnography, a significant amount of data ori ginates in and 
manifests through digital traces of naturally occurring public conversations recorded by 
contemporary communications networks (Addeo et al., 2019; Kozinets & Gambetti, 2021) . 
It is particularly useful for studying online -based communities, such as those found on 
Reddit, where individuals engage in discussions, share experiences, and seek support. 
Netnography allows researchers to gain a deep understanding of human experiences,  
capture different perspectives, and explore various aspects of social phenomena (Bartl et 
al., 2016; Wicaksana & Candrasari, 2023)  . 
It is important to acknowledge the limitations of netnography as a research methodology.  
One limitation is the potential for incomplete or biased data, as the researcher's access is 
limited to publicly available data on a given platform (Kozinets et al., 2014) . Additionally, 
netnography relies on self -reported data and may be subject to issues, such as selective 
self-presentation and limited generalizability (Belk et al., 2020) . To overcome these

 limitations  and triangulate the findings,  a multifaceted  netnographic  approach was 
implemented, combining data scraping and content analysis . 
Reddit  
Reddit was selected as the primary research platform for this study due to its vibrant and 
diverse user community, particularly in the context of art creation. With millions of active 
users and a wide range of specialized subreddits, Reddit provides a rich source of data and 
insights into the experiences, perspectives, and  challenges faced by artists using GAI tools.  
Discussions on Reddit are primarily public in that anyone, with or without a Reddit 
account, can view the content ( with the exception of private subreddits).  Both the original 
shared content and discussion comments are “voted” on by users, which influences their 
visibility.  To become a Reddit user, all that is required is to select a unique username, and 
password —email verification is not needed.  The terms of service dictate that users must 
be at least 13 years old to sign up.  Site-wide norms discourage par ticipation with one’s real 
name as a privacy   protecting measure. As participation in Reddit is pseudonymous, 
demographic information is difficult to obtain.  According to Reddit’s website 
administrators (Reddit.com, 2022), there are more than 57 million daily active unique 
users, with over 100,000 active communities.  Forty -five percent of users were between 18 
and 29 years old, and users between 30 and 49 years 30-and 49-years old account for 
another 40%.  Fifty -nine percent of the users were male (Intelligence, 2016) . Subreddits are 
both user -created and user -moderated. While there are a few overarching Reddit rules 
regarding content, subreddits vary considerably in terms of what they allow , and in their 
specific cultures and norms (Proferes et al., 2021) .  
Following conventional Reddit research methods (Adams, 2022) , data collection involved 
scraping textual data from the selected subreddits, including post titles, body text, 
comments, and metadata.  Apify Reddit scraper software was used to automate the data 
scraping process (Baumgartner et al., 2020; Proferes et al., 2021) . The collected data was 
then stored in a structured  XLS  format for subsequent analysis . The crawler was configured 
to include only posts from the last six months, to remain up to date, and to explore the 
 
8 
 effects of up -to-date AI generating engines.  Data collection was limited to 10K results and 
omitted identifying information  from the database analyzed  due to ethical considerations.5,6

The inclusion criteri on for analysis was that the posts were read by the researcher. If the 
post was selected and relevant , all the comments for the post were also included (Jacques 
et al., 2023) . Overall,  the analysis include d 61 post s and 397 comments.

A qualitative approach was employed to analyze the collected data (Pleasure et al., 2022) . 
Thematic coding, a widely used qualitative analysis method, was used to identify patterns, 
themes, and categories within textual data (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Kozinets, 2015) . This 
allowed for systematic exploration of the effects, experiences, and challenges associated 
with using GAI in the context of art creation  . 
Regarding ethical considerations, the study adhered to Reddit’s terms of service and 
respected the community norms and guidelines established within the subreddits . The data  
collected from the subreddits w asn’t  anonymized as it is publicly available on Reddit 
platform and on Google search engine  (Anne -Marie et al., 2017; Kozinets & Gambetti, 
2021; Proferes et al., 2021) . 
The limitations of netnography were addressed by combining netnographic techniques with 
qualitative analysis  and interpretation using post -phenomenological theories.  The post-
phenomenological  analysis of the collected data allowed for a deeper exploration of the 
effects and implications of using GAI on art creation, providing rich and nuanced insights 
into the experiences and perspectives of artists .

 Finding s and Results  
Intentionality  
Intentionality is a key concept in understanding the role of human agency . It is a key 
concept in the philosophy of self, and it has been and has been defined and interpreted in 
many different ways over the years (Anscombe, 1957; Searle, 2010; Smith, 2017) . Searle 
define d intentionality as: ‘that feature of certain mental states and events that consists in 
their being directed at, being about of, or representing certain other entities and state s of 
affairs’  (Searle, 1983, p. 1) . In artistic creation, intentionality can refer to the visual or 
aesthetic goals that guide an artist’s creative process, shaping the envisioned outcomes that 
prior intentions aim to realize (Kolak, 1990) .  
Searle (2010) argued that there are two different types of intentions that should be 
distinguished from one another.  The first type involves intention directed towards a 
triggering action.  An example of this type is formulating the intention to raise one’s hand 
in 30 seconds. Searle calls this ‘prior intention .’ The second type of intention relates to the 
action itself – when, after the 30 seconds have elapsed, the actor indeed raises their hand. 
Searle calls this ‘intention in action .’ Searle’s argument is that in every action we perform , 
we take for granted the s ocial context that we are embedded in. This context consists of 
beliefs, abilities, and possibilities, as manifested in prior intention.  Nevertheless, Searle 
indicated that action cannot be created without intention for in action.  
Evans et al.  (2017, p. 36)  defined affordances as possibilities for action between an 
object/technology and the user that enable or constrain potential behavioral outcomes in a 
particular context.  AI art generators produce new affordances, neither exclusively human 
nor algorithmic, but somewhere in between in their common space (Gibson, 1979) . This 
enables the possibility of delegating one’s intentions to the AI art generator so that it can 
produce new intentions in place of one’s own — for example, to generate an image or text.   
The post titled " I lost everything that made me love my job through Midjourney overnight ," 
brings attention to the phenomenon of outsourcing the core of art creation and the 
consequential loss of artistic intentionality. The artist expresses their frustration by stating, 
"If I want to 'prompt' something and the algorithm gives me something el se—at the very 
least, I am losing some intentionality" (Sternsafari, 2023) . This highlights the artist's 
 
10 
 concern about the deviation from their original artistic intentions, their diminishi ng agency, 
and the loss of control over their creative process .  
When considering the theoretical perspectives of John Searle and Bruno Latour, we can 
further analyze the implications of technological mediation through delegation of artistic  
intentionality. Searle's multifaceted concept of intentionality explains the artist's concern 
about losing intentionality.  The artist's frustration stems from the algorithmic mediation  
dictating the outcomes, which deviates from their original intentions. Latour's  (1992)  idea 
of delegation  sheds light on the power dynamics at play. By delegating their intentions to 
GAI, artists relinquish some of their agency, allowing the algorithm to shape the creative 
output and conform it to algorithmic rationality.  
The Dance of Agencies  
Autonomy and agency are essential for understanding the dynamic relationship between 
human creators and GAI machines.  Autonomy refers to the capacity for self -governed 
action based on one's own integrated but open -ended preferences and principles  (Kupfer, 
1987) . Agency denotes the ability to act or exert power towards meaningful ends  (Verbeek, 
2005) . Andrew  Pickering  (2010)  argues that agency is not solely the prerogative of human 
actors but can also emerge from interactions between humans and non -human entities .  He 
claims that agency is not a fixed attribute possessed by individual actors but rather a 
relational and emergent property that arises from the entanglement of human and non -
human elements.  
Generative AI art creation processes have introduced a transformative shift in agency in 
the art world (Hutson & Schnellmann, 2023) . The notion of the artist as the singular 
creative genius responsible for producing artwork has deep historical roots in Western 
culture  (Bilton, 2010) . The work of art was presumed to be the reflection, the outward 
radiance, of the artist's  own imaginative depth and power  (Pollock, 1980, pp. 58 –59).  
The advent of GAI systems destabilizes this cultural notion  of individual human agency in 
art. Multifaceted networks emerge , binding datasets , artists, platforms,  algorithms , and 
publics  (Epstein et al., 2020) .  
 
11 
 The changes in agency contribute to changes in meaning and interpretation . A comment to 
a post titled , “I am scared of my own drawing” claims that , “New artists often accidentally 
create images that may appear one way or another. This is usually due to a lack of control 
and has nothing to do with any subconscious intent”  (Bonabbyteit, 2023) . 
We can see that GAI machines possess their own form of agency, albeit distinct from 
human agency. These machines can autonomously generate artistic output s based on 
learned patterns and algorithms. They contribute to the creation process by producing novel 
and unexpected artistic expressions  (Gülaçti & Kahraman, 2021) . This challenges the 
traditional notion of  artistic  agency as solely human -centered, and introduces a 
collaborative dance of agencies between human creators and GAI machines . It is not 
merely a matter of losing human intentionality and a divergence of logic but a 
transformation in the entire agency ecosystem.  The interplay between human agency and 
the agency embodied by GAI machines alters the dynamics of art creation. It challenges 
the traditional notions of authorship, authorial control, and boundaries of artistic 
expression  . 
Rationality  
This section illustrates  three rationalities shaping art creation in the age of GAI—rationality 
as realization of  creative intentions, optimizing economic productivity, and conforming to 
algorithmic logic. As these distinct paradigms interact, tensions emerge that challenge and 
change artistic rationalit y – the internal reasoning and decision -making that guides the 
artist’s process to effectively realize aesthetic goals, from envisioned intentions to final 
work  (Bar-Gil, 2020) . 
Rationality as Realization of Prior Intention  
Rationality plays a crucial role in art -making, shaping the intentions and decisions of artists 
as they bring their creative visions to life.  Rationality refers to the organized mental logic 
that people and systems use to set goals and make choices to achieve desired outcomes  
(Earl, 2016) . The concept of "prior intention" is central to understanding the rationality of 
artistic creation. Searle ( 2010 ) described prior intention as an internal plan of action that 
guides the artist's creative process.  It involves envisioning the desired outcome and 
 
12 
 mapping the steps to achieve it.  The realization of prior intention reflects the artist's rational 
assessment of functionality and actuation of possibilities.  
In the context of algorithmic systems, the realization of prior intention takes on a new 
dimension. The fusion of human intentions and machine imaginations introduces a gap 
between the artist's original vision and the outcomes produced by the algorithm. This gap, 
referred to as the "causality gap" by Searle (2010) , allows for preservation of the illusion 
of free will (Fisher, 2020) . While algorithmic systems can execute actions based on prior 
intentions, they do not fully capture the nuances of human agency and creative expression.  
Economic Rational Logic of Mass Production  
Economic rational logic is evident in the push for the automation and commodification of 
artistic processes.  Proponents of GAI argue that it can automate their work, enhancing 
efficiency and productivity  (Frey, 2020) . However, this perspective overlooks the intrinsic 
value and significance of artistic labor . Artistic creation  often stands in contrast to the 
economic rationality of mass production, prioritizing efficiency, standardization, and cost -
effectiveness  (Epstein et al., 2020; Gülaçti & Kahraman, 2021) . As artists navigate the 
commercial art world, they face tension between pursuing their creative vision and 
conforming to the demands of the market forces (Epstein et al., 2020) . The affordances of 
mass production and the commodification of art conferred by using AI have led to the 
rationalization of artistic practices to align with those economic objectives.  “I saw many 
people fail . … The pressure of doing the thing you are supposed to enjoy but have to in 
order to make a living sometimes takes the fun out of it and can even burn you out” 
(OleanderYuri, 2023) .  
On a post titled:   “Do you love art?”  Another user responded that the market expectations 
of market relevance and visibility forced him to learn how to use the new tools available 
to him: “I am on the side of thinking that we do have to use every tool available to us to 
get to that point where we can be relevant and visible in our professions as soon as 
possible. ” (bodymemory1, 2023) . 
This sentiment was reinforced in other posts as well:  “New artists who learn how to use 
new tools will succeed better. Similarly, automobiles replaced horses.  People kept on with 
new tools”  (ScionoicS, 2023) . 
 
13 
 The public debate in the media, as reflected in a n LA Times article, details a similar 
sentiment expressed by artists regarding the delegation of their work to AI systems. It 
emphasizes  that art is deeply rooted in the artist's identity and passion, stating : "Art is not 
scrubbing toilets . ... We make art because it is who we are" (Crabapple, 2022) . This quote 
underlines the intrinsic connection between artists and their work, highlighting their 
commitment and love for their craft. The article further asserts that AI generator evangelists  
fail to understand the profound dedication that artists have to their work and the value they 
place on the personal expression it entails.  This type of discussion was reflected in a 
comment to the previous post: “Your statement made me think about the love of a 
profession. Now there’s a hot topic. How do you really know you love something you do? 
Are you infatuated with it? ” (bodymemory1, 2023) .  
Algorithmic Rationality , Impression , Intention , and Imagination  
The adoption of algorithmic systems introduces a distinct form of rationality: algorithmic 
rationality. Fisher (2020)  explains that algorithmic rationality is rooted in optimization, 
efficiency, and data -driven decision -making. It represents a departure from artistic 
rationality, as it relies on computational algorithms and statistical models to generate 
output. Algorithm ic systems possess their own unique imagination, shaped by patterns and 
biases extracted from training data.  However, the reliance on algorithmic rationality can 
suppress artistic imagination. The algorithmic way of thinking, while capable of generating 
novel and creative output, does so in a non -human manner (Doneson, 2019; Mehozay & 
Fisher, 2019) . The algorithm operate s with its own unique imagination, which may diverge 
from human artistic imaginatio n. As algorithms dictate artistic styles and trends based on 
GAI, it may curtail eccentricity  and divergence  integral to artistic imagination and 
creativity.  
“Focus on the soul. If the difference between you and Midjourney is that your art has some 
meaning or soul behind it, then you want to focus on that. Your art is likely similar enough 
to thousands of other artists that the AI will be able to do something w hich already lets the 
AI Bros make some imitation” (LukeTheCyberpunk, 2023) . 
Combining these two rationalities , we can notice that as algorithms drive art towards 
economic -algorithmic logic, the personal and creative dimensions art holds will erode , and 
 
14 
 art risks becoming an abstract, impersonal commodity deprived of rich artistic 
intentionality.  
Connective Memory: Bridging Personal, Collective, and Generative AI Systems  
Andrew Hoskins  (2011, 2017)  introduced the concept of connective memory as a 
framework that expands our understanding of memory beyond the notions of personal or 
collective memory. Connective memory encompasses the intersections between personal 
experiences, collective narratives, and digital technology . Connective memory emphasizes 
the interconnectedness and dynamic nature of memory in the digital age. It encompasses 
the ways in which individuals and communities engage with, curate, create , and access  a 
broader network of cultural memories through digital platforms and technologies . 
Generative AI systems serve as new forms of connective memory by leveraging their 
capacity to analyze vast amounts of  data (in the form of artistic content ), replicate styles, 
and generate novel output. These systems function as repositories of artistic knowledge, 
accumulating a vast repertoire of visual and conceptual elements from diverse sources  
(Pošćić & Kreković, 2020) . Through their algorithmic operations, they establish intricate 
connections and associations between these elements, forming a connective network of 
artistic references (Elgammal et al., 2017) .  
One compelling example of this is the work of the Turkish artist Refik Anadol. Using 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithms and datasets consisting of millions of 
publicly available  images, Anadol  creates mesmerizing "data sculptures." In his "Machine 
Hallucinations" series7, Anadol visualizes and explores the collective memory held within 
these massive datasets, generating new artistic expressions that highlight the 
interconnectedness of digital culture and human experiences (Harriet Flavel, 2022) . 
The emergence of GAI systems as connective memory has significant implications for the 
artistic creation process. Artists are no longer limited to their individual experiences or 
traditional sources of personal or collective inspiration. They can tap into a vast and 
constantly evolving network of artistic references, including digital memor ies present on 
the cloud and in internet servers. This expanded connective memory provides artists with

15 
 new ways to interpret and inspire the creation of art, constantly reshaping the patterns and 
possibilities of artistic expression . 
Furthermore, the continuous cycle of content creation and algorithmic learning amplifies 
the connective memory ecosystem. As new artwork and data are generated, they become 
part of the collective memory, feeding into the network  and influencing future artistic 
endeavors . This dynamic process redefines the relationship between artists, machines, and 
the evolving landscape of  global connective  memory . Some artist s see these forms of 
humanless connection as making their art a “dataset” for algorithm training:  “As the 
number of people interested in my art and commissions increase, I find myself fearing that 
my art -style will become yet another dataset to train one of those soulless Jpeg generators 
like Midjourney” (LukeTheCyberpunk, 2023) . 
Discussion  
This article examined the intersection of GAI systems and the realm of artistic creation, 
focusing on their implications for intentionality , agency, rationality , and memory . These 
systems leverage vast datasets and algorithmic operations to accumulate and connect 
artistic references, providing artists with an expanded network of inspiration and reshaping 
the patterns of artistic expression.  
The mediation of i ntentionality causing  reconsideration of authorship in a dance of 
agenc ies becomes distributed across networks binding humans and algorithms . Competing 
rationalities emerge around artistic expression versus economic optimization and 
conformity to algorithmic logic  and imagination ; the artistic memory expands from being 
personal and connective  to include vast algorithmic databases, functioning as a dynamic 
connective  memory archive for artistic recollection and inspiration .  
Limitations of the Study and Future Resear ch 
This study utilized netnography as a research methodology to explore the intersection of 
GAI systems and artistic creation on   user communication in  Reddit  subforums. Several 
methodological limitations should  be considered.  
First, the data collection method poses limitations in terms of representativeness and 
generalizability. Netnographic research heavily relies on online observations and 
 
16 
 interactions within specific online communities, which may not fully capture the diversity 
of artistic practices and perspectives. The findings of this study are specific to the selected 
subreddits and may not be applicable to other online platforms or art istic communities.  
Furthermore, the study's focus on Reddit as the primary research site introduces limitations 
in terms of the platform's user demographics and biases. Reddit's user base tends to be 
skewed towards certain demographics, which may influence the types of discussions and 
content shared  (Proferes et al., 2021) . This limits the generalizability of the findings to a 
broader population of artists and art enthusiasts.  
Finally , the reliance on self -reported data and observations within the online community 
poses limitations in terms of reliability and validity. Netnographic research heavily relies 
on individuals' self -presentation and self -disclosure, which may not always refle ct their 
true thoughts, motivations, or behaviors  (Kozinets, 2015) . The researcher's interpretations 
and biases also play a role in shaping the analysis and findings.  
Considering these methodological limitations, future research in this area could incorporate 
a more diverse range of data collection methods, such as interviews or surveys, to capture 
a broader range of perspectives and experiences.  Comparative analysis across different 
online platforms and communities can provide insights into how artists engage with AI -
generated content in various contexts. Additionally, adopting a mixed -methods approach 
that combines netnographic research with quali tative interviews or s urveys can offer a 
deeper understanding of artists' perceptions and experiences when using GAI systems. 
Longitudinal studies can track the evolution of artistic practices over time, while fostering 
cross -disciplinary collaborations can facilitate innovative artistic practices and uncover 
new aesthetic possibilities. By pursuing research in these areas, we can enhance our 
understanding of the impact and potential of GAI systems in artistic creation.  
The Changing Notion of Art—What Will the Future Look Like for Artistic Creation?  
“The only thing AI has done is convince me that art is just a bunch of bullshit”  
(LukeTheCyberpunk, 2023) . 
The ontological and categorical dualities that Sorgner  (2022) identifies as constitutive of 
the posthuman art culture are discussed in his book "philosophy of posthuman art."  As 
 
17 
 GAI reshapes artistic creation, foundational questions resurface around technology's 
potential to disrupt or devalue the essence of human artistry.  While expanding possibilities, 
the mediating role of algorithms risks eclipsing the humanistic dimensions of art, as 
forewarned by Heidegger's warnings about technology's enframing effects. In his seminal 
work "The Question Concerning Technology," Martin Heidegger (1953/2008)  explores the 
transformative impact of technology on our relationship with the world. He argues that 
technology, driven by its inherent enframing nature  (Gestell) , reduces human s in front of 
technology  to a mere standing -reserve, stripping away the true essence and revealing only 
instrumental value. Heidegger contends that art, on the other hand, has the potential to 
transcend this stance and reveal the world in its authentic and meaningful form  (Gestell ). 
The human intention  and the genuine connection between the artist and the artwork may 
be overshadowed by the predetermined patterns  and datasets  dictated by AI algorithms.   
Walter Benjamin's insights on the loss of aura , its unique presence and  the authenticity of 
one-of-a-kind artwork,  in the age of technological reproducibility provide a valuable lens 
through which we can examine the implications of GAI on the artistic realm . Benjamin 
argued that the unique existence of a work of art bears the mark of its historical context 
and cannot be fully replicated in reproductions. He astutely observed that even the most 
perfect reproduction lacks the distinct aura tied to the artwork 's history  (Benjamin, 
1935/2008, p. 21) . In the context of GAI, which produces art through algorithmic 
processes, the question arises: Does the loss of aura, as understood by Benjamin, extend to 
this form of AI -generated art? While Benjamin's ideas were primarily focused on the 
reproducibility of traditional artwor k, his emphasis on the loss of the here and now and the 
historical context can be applied to the GAI context . 
In GAI systems, algorithms and computational processes mediate  the individual artistic 
intention . The GAI system becomes the primary agent in the creation of art, and one might 
consider it detached from the historical lineage and personal expression that Benjamin 
attributes to the aura. As Benjamin wrote in his famous  letter to Adorno : "I now find it 
somewhat disturbing ... that you have now rather casually transferred the concept of the 
magical aura to the 'autonomous work of work' and flatly assigned a counter -revolutionary 
function to the latter" (Benjamin, quoted in  (Osborne & Charles, 2015, p. 25) . 
 
18 
 Therefore, the introduction of GAI art can be seen as a further departure from Benjamin's 
notion of aura, as the art is detached from the unique existence and historical embeddedness 
of the artist. Instead, GAI art emerges from the current collective -algorithmic "memory" in 
the cloud and internet servers, constantly reshaping its form and patterns. It also challenges 
what the artists are consider ing as  ‘art’ in its broad sense:  
It has just made me realize that art is just expression. That is all it has ever been. 
And frankly, I don't care about the umbrella term of "art". I love painting because 
of what it makes me feel; not because it is "art". I don't share common bonds or 
ideas with "artists" who meddle in mediums I have never touched. The concept of 
art and artists is as vague as is the difference between a painter and a welder, a 
sandwich artist, a spear thrower. They all inhabit expressions in one form or 
another, but for th e past decade there has been thorough brainwashing about what 
"art" is (LukeTheCyberpunk, 2023) . 
Heidegger's call for art as a transformative force that reawakens our connection with the 
world stands as a powerful reminder of the need for genuine human expression in the face 
of algorithmic creation. Benjamin's keen observations on the loss of aura and  the temporal, 
technological, and cultural contingencies of art challenge us to critically examine the 
authenticity and uniqueness of artistic experiences in the age of AI -generated 
reproductions.  
Summary  
As GAI systems reshape the landscape of artistic creation, we must confront the 
fundamental question of whether these technological advancements can fully capture the 
depth and essence of human artistic expression. The transformative potential of art lies not 
only in its aesthetic qualities , but also in its ability to evoke emotional responses, challenge 
conventions, and offer profound insights into the human condition  (Millet et al., 2023) . 
While GAI may produce visually stunning and technically impressive works, it remains a 
crucial task to reflect on the subtle nuances of artistic intention, the irreplaceable aura of 
the here and now, and the dynamic interplay between the artist, the artwork, and the viewer.  
 
19 
 In this era of unprecedented technological progress, it is essential to preserve the integrity 
of artistic creation and the rich tapestry of human experiences that art embodies. Embracing 
the possibilities offered by GAI while remaining vigilant about its potential pitfalls is key. 
By engaging in critical discourse, nurturing the creative spirit, and cultivating a deep 
appreciation for the profound and transformative power of art, we can navigate the complex 
intersection of technology and artistic expression, forging a future where human agency, 
authenticity, and the enduring relev ance of art thrive.
