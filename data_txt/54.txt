In recent years, HCI research around post-anthropocene design
has been gaining traction. Caring and inclusive stances towards
more-than-humans, multispecies dialogues, and decentering the
human in design are imbuing HCI and other disciplines. Similarly,
critical heritage scholars have pointed to the need to re-frame

heritage in light of the challenges of the Anthropocene. As part
of a heritage-focused EU-funded project, we extend these efforts,
thinking through collaborative research-through-design to design
"Biotopia" – a transmedia experience that aims to connect mu-
seum and nature walk visitors with entangled natureculture and
more-than-human heritage. We propose three Design Constructs
from our exploratory phase and detail how they have informed
the design of the critical heritage experience, contributing with
the transmedia experience design and proposing ways of applying
emerging posthuman concepts in practice. By reflecting on our
process, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of designing
for more-than-human heritage in a posthuman world, working
towards decentered practices in HCI.

1 Introduction
The criteria for creating and selecting heritage have long been de-
bated, particularly in the context of authorized heritage discourses
(AHD) that reinforce Western elitist values and histories [ 46,47,78].
These processes often limit the potential scope of what heritage
can represent. While natural heritage is frequently perceived as a
static category, it is also socially and culturally constructed [ 70],
making it an integral part of AHD. The interplay between culture
and nature within heritage narratives is especially pertinent amidst
global challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss. We
contribute to these discussions by presenting the design of a novel
transmedia experience informed by proposed design constructs –
guiding principles derived from posthuman proposals and our ex-
ploratory research that informed and shaped the development of
the design ideas and prototypes.
The work presented in this paper is part of the broader context of
the LoGa Culture EU project, focused on promoting accessible and
ethical heritage practices by using collaborative digital tools that
provide inclusive access to both tangible and intangible cultural
heritage. The project addresses diverse challenges within heritage
landscapes and cultural institutions by involving various technical,
social, and artistic partners across three European sites. The work
discussed here is part of a case study that takes a nature-inclusive ap-
proach to heritage, aiming to enhance local well-being and support
sustainable development. Contextualised in the Madeira Islands, its
heritage comprises natural sites with cultural aspects where natureis considered a central tenant of its cultural heritage. The assump-
tion and challenges for this case study are twofold: i) relying on
posthuman theories, nature is inseparable from culture, being both
a man-defined construct that can be referred to as natureculture
[34]; ii) the importance of feeling aware of and connected with
nature is a key component of the local culture and should be highly
valued by locals and visitors to the islands, who should be supported
in preservation and conservation actions towards such heritage
[27].
The prevailing heritage narratives often centre on human ap-
preciation and value materiality over meaning [ 73], neglecting the
entangled relationships between humans, more-than-humans, and
their environments. This anthropocentric focus marginalizes al-
ternative perspectives, particularly in regions where natural and
cultural heritage are inseparable. With the Anthropocene urging
critical reflection on human-nature relationships [ 21], it is vital
to challenge established heritage frameworks and foster inclusive,
diverse, and sustainable narratives. Posthuman theories, feminist
posthumanism, and critical heritage studies offer frameworks to de-
center humans and incorporate multispecies perspectives [13, 45].
This research aligns with these efforts by exploring how technol-
ogy and design can contribute to diverse and pluriversal heritage
narratives.
We respond to Braidotti’s [ 14] call to materialize posthuman
theory with a focus on "displacing anthropocentrism", also working
towards consolidating "a wide array of posthumanist approaches
to design and HCI under the overarching idea of the more-than-
human" [ 41]. Combining exploratory research, stakeholder engage-
ment, and Research-through-Design (RtD) [ 38,88], this study aims
to: i) develop design constructs that support nature-inclusive her-
itage practices, ii) create a transmedia experience that engages users
with entangled cultural and natural narratives, and iii) demonstrate
how posthuman theories can inform HCI practices. These aims
led to the exploration of an emergent type of heritage: more-than-
human heritage . This concept is explored through the design of a
transmedia experience – a connected narrative experienced through
different media, each one adding something different to the over-
all story [ 51,52]. The experience is connected to popular natural
hotspots and a natural history museum to generate digitally en-
riching and inspiring experiences of and in these naturally and cul-
turally entangled landscapes. According to Sterling, the challenge
lies in "how can critical thinking in the contact zone of heritage
studies engage with the urgent challenges of the present in a way
that is analytically insightful and socio-politically transformative"
[79]. We use our design practice to detail considerations around
posthuman HCI and critical heritage, contributing to ongoing dis-
cussions around these pressing design challenges and illustrating
pathways of formalizing posthuman ideas into design practice.
After the positionality and reflexivity subsection, the remainder
of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the theoret-
ical background and related work; Section 3 details the exploratory
research that informed the design; Section 4 describes the three
design constructs and how they were used in the design of Biotopia ;
Section 5 discusses the research-through-design process, reflects
on more-than-human representation and critical heritage design,
and closes with future directions.

1.1 Research Context, Positionality and
Reflexivity
Madeira islands are an outermost region of Europe recognized by
Article 349 TFEU. These regions are special because of their remote-
ness, rich biodiversity and natural resources. They are also very
dependent on limited economic activities, in particular tourism.
This case study attempts to promote a deeper understanding of
natural and cultural heritage as an integrated system and a basis
for holistic management in touristic destinations that are simulta-
neously biodiversity preservation spots and highly dependent on
tourism as an economic activity.
The areas of expertise of the authors mainly focus on commu-
nication design, HCI, architecture, neuroscience, psychology and
computer science. Within the LoGa Culture project and our par-
ticular work package, our primary responsibility was to mindfully
reflect with the social, cultural, and technical partners to finally
design a posthuman intervention related to Madeira’s heritage
formalized as a transmedia experience. All project partners were
actively invested in using the project tools to increase inclusion, re-
spect, and conservation of nature, enhance multispecies dialogues,
and highlight the local communities’ values and stories. To this
end, the project explicitly stated to nurture actions that contribute
to, rather than undermine, practices of recognizing differences by
giving individuals a voice to promote cultural diversity.
The authors of this publication have all lived and worked in
Lisbon and/or Funchal. We saw ourselves as "HCI and design ex-
perts" and "friendly outsiders" of the local community committed to
learning from and standing with the participants. We acknowledge
to partially understand the larger systems in natural and cultural
heritage contexts, and acknowledge the bias that our expertise and
experiences bring to this research.
Posthuman theory is something designers actively create through
their own research and practice in more-than-human design [ 57].
In such a complex context as designing in the Anthropocene with
posthuman considerations, the "correct" path (if it even exists) is
not a linear one. On the contrary, it can be a very controversial
endeavour molded by the researchers’ experiences. We have not
set out to define a methodology for posthuman HCI practices for
critical heritage, but illustrate the complexity of such a process and
discuss the design considerations that can assist in a sustainable
and inclusive path forward.
2 Background and Related Work
First, we propose an overview of the posthuman HCI theories we
build on to inform our critical heritage views and the heritage ap-
proach chosen. We then focus on a branch of critical heritage –
more-than-human heritage – the approach explored in the trans-
media experience design. We close by analyzing related works in
HCI and transmedia interventions for more-than-human heritage.
2.1 Critical Heritage and Posthuman HCI
Design researchers have been debating the role and responsibilities
of design in the current Anthropocene. Interest in moving beyond
human exceptionalism and human-centric design is rising, withscholars advocating for broader ethical considerations beyond hu-
mans [ 31,32,58]. Braidotti [ 15] argues that we are witnessing a con-
vergence of posthumanism , which rejects the humanist ideal of the
human as the universal measure, and post-anthropocentrism , which
rejects species hierarchy and human exceptionalism. This shift
prompts a transition from user-centered design to inclusive posthu-
manistic perspectives [ 5,84] that need to support equality and jus-
tice for humans and nonhumans simultaneously [ 32]. The current
entanglement HCI age is greatly influenced by posthuman theo-
ries such as posthumanism, feminism, and post-phenomenology
applied to science and technological innovation [ 33]. This wave
understands relations between humans, more-than-humans and
objects as producing realities through their interactions [ 49]. Knowl-
edge is shown to be socially constructed, and technologies become
entangled in and with our bodies and lives. As Ulmer puts it, "the
importance of posthumanism may not be in knowing, but in ex-
ploring how we are entangled with other organisms around us"
[83]. This call greatly inspired us to explore our (humans’) entan-
glements with the diverse environments and actors around us and
how these relations influence our view of heritage.
These approaches advocate for a broadening of design participa-
tion to include more-than-human interactions [ 1] to ground design
in more-than-human perspectives [ 41], fostering wider understand-
ing and collaboration [ 6,22]. Diverse theoretical views and applied
experimentation have been developed recently, attempting to re-
define what design could and should be in the post-Anthropocene.
Wakkary has proposed ‘designing-with’ as an approach where
humans share the stage with nonhumans and are "materially, ethi-
cally, and existentially" connected [ 84]. Fuchsberger and Frauen-
berger [ 35] propose that ‘doing responsibilities’ should be carried
out within hybrid assemblages of both humans and nonhumans,
grounded in fluid relationships. Concepts such as co-performance
and co-creation with more-than humans [ 55,69], entanglements
[33], fluid assemblages [ 74], or methods like noticing with more-
than-humans [ 9,60,71], sketching in nature [ 29], material specu-
lations [ 10,65,85], or photographic observations [ 11], have been
proposed and explored to assist in orienting HCI posthumanistic
way forward. These strategies help the researcher to think "differ-
ently and re-envisioning research" in the "uncertain messiness of
knowledge production as an ongoing opportunity in a politics of
hope, creativity, and imagination" [ 83]. We have applied several
of these methods in our explorations into posthumanistic heritage
design to broaden our perspectives.
In line with these posthuman approaches in HCI, modern ap-
proaches to heritage have begun to include diverse voices and
perspectives in their discourse, favouring a polyvocal, critical, and
future-oriented view of heritage [42, 44]. Posthumanism in heritage
studies challenges the idea that humans are the sole producers
of knowledge, instead acknowledging the potential for other be-
ings, objects and phenomena [ 83]. Critical heritage has emerged
as a sub-field in heritage studies that asks "uncomfortable ques-
tions of traditional ways of thinking about and doing heritage"
[19] working towards democratisation, decolonisation, inclusion of
marginalised perspectives, and a shift towards non-human centered
approaches. Critical heritage sees heritage as a political, cultural,
and social phenomenon [40] that should consider dynamics such as
162
DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal Ferreira, et al.
power, identity or conflicts; a phenomenon that crosses human and
non-human worlds [34].
Posthumanism and critical heritage call for "thinking and doing
heritage otherwise", through an "alliance of critical heritage praxis
and critical posthumanist thinking" [ 79] as possible pathways for an
expansion of the field. The various ‘components’ that form heritage ,
including museology, tourism, site management, or interpretation,
should be addressed with a critical lens. Traditional museology
often perpetuates colonial and exclusionary narratives, demanding
that current heritage practices become more inclusive, reflective,
and reparative by engaging communities and revising narratives.
Museums, in particular, can be places of dialogue and transforma-
tion [ 80]. Through this work, we resonate with previous research
[46,68,79] by expanding on traditional views of heritage to include
more critical posthuman views explored through posthuman HCI.
In particular, we focused on exploring ways of diversifying heritage
voices and perspectives, going beyond the normative authorized
heritage discourses (AHD) [ 46,78]. Critical-creative heritage prac-
tice can assist in tackling important societal challenges, such as
climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and environmental jus-
tice [ 79], and HCI can propel these endeavours. These complex
issues are formed by multiple and situated entanglements of hu-
mans, more-than-humans and their different temporalities, and
critical heritage can harness the liveliness of the posthuman debate
to engage with these complex topics. Considering these aspects,
we decided to explore more-than-human heritage that articulates
the diversity, relationality, and pluriversality of posthuman critical
heritage. Moving away from the limited view of the ‘privileged
human’ [ 13], with research-through-design we work towards post-
anthropocentric and decentered perspectives of heritage [ 79] that
thrive to include non-human voices and their role in heritage con-
ceptualization and creation.
2.2 Heritage as Interconnectivity:
More-than-human Heritage
Heritage has recently started embracing the “nonhuman turn” [ 43].
The promotion of human dominance over nature and ignoring
multi-species interdependencies has been critiqued by Tsing [ 82],
aligning with Haraway’s [ 45] view that this mindset is conceited
and shortsighted. Such perspectives risk undervaluing sustainable
inter-species relationships by excluding many actors. It is important
to consider human perception of heritage, but allowing this ‘cultural
filter’ to appropriate all notions of ‘nature’ furthers human-centered
and purely human-meaning-making perspectives [ 34]. Braidotti
[13] suggests viewing subject positions as figurations rather than
identities, seeing humans as ‘more-than-humans’, embedded in
complex natureculture relationships. This posthuman shift is pro-
pelled by posthuman feminism’s responses to contemporary narrow
anthropocentric views [ 16]. Naturecultures need to be acknowl-
edged as crucial in heritage practices.
The complex interconnections between human and non-human
beings, the realities outside our human perception, and self-knowledge
of our responsibilities are crucial aspects to consider [ 63]. The idea
of ‘intercorporeality’, attempting to become ‘more than ourselves’
through, for example, deep observation of natural processes, is
one example of working towards broadening our perception andrelations to others [48]. Human experience is inseparable from our
local ecologies [ 83], and our way of perceiving and representing
nonhuman perspectives is always relational and situated, demand-
ing a critical assessment of one’s biases [ 41]. More-than-human
contributions need to be considered in heritage creation as they
change the way landscapes are ‘created’. Furthermore, "heritage
sites and monuments can be understood as assemblages that gather
the world around them in situated ways" [ 34], representing im-
portant contexts of use that help shape ideals that could inspire
alternative sustainable practices. Importantly, these heritage experi-
ences can work purposefully to restore positive and hopeful visions
in diverse multi-species communities. Haraway [ 44], for instance,
proposes a focus on care between different species over time as
an alternative to catastrophe-focused histories. These strategies
that consider more-than-human agencies work towards inspiring
de-colonizing practices through heritage [34].
Nicenboim et al. ask “what is decentered and what is instead
accounted for” when designing for decentering in HCI [ 66]. In the
case of this research, we work towards more-than-human heritage
by recognising and deeply considering the complex systems we hu-
mans inhabit, interacting with non-human entities such as technol-
ogy, animals and the environment [ 41]. In critically engaging with
the different contexts that form the experience’s entangled environ-
ment, we strive to decenter the human-focused and user-focused
directions in the design process. These considerations challenged us
to move away from human exceptionalism by confronting different
scales to the natural heritage context and the entanglements of
these complex environments, aiming to bring an alternative and
more inclusive narrative to the museology we were intervening in.
Throughout the design process, we aimed to explore new ways of
bringing more-than-human voices and narratives to the heritage
experience.
2.3 Transmedia and HCI for More-than-human
Heritage
The growing disconnection between humans and nature has been
mentioned as one contributor to the environmental crisis [ 67,89].
Therefore, exploring ways of enhancing this connection is of crucial
importance.
2.3.1 HCI for More-than-human Heritage.
A critical shift in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) involves
reconceptualising participation to include more-than-human stake-
holders [ 31,32]. In this direction, various strategies have emerged
that challenge anthropocentric design paradigms. For instance,
frameworks such as phenology probes [ 75] and Natureculture
probes [ 8,36] explore human-nature relationships through sensory
and temporal mappings, advancing sustainable and participatory
design practices. Similarly, the Umwelt-sketch methodology seeks
to decenter the human by visualising overlapping "Umwelts" of
non-human actors, thereby fostering more inclusive design inter-
ventions [ 24]. These approaches align with broader calls for ethical
participatory practices that integrate plants, animals, and spirits
into the design process [1].
Digital tools further extend these participatory efforts by lever-
aging mobile and place-based learning to uncover the relational
affordances of nature, cultivating curiosity and deeper connection
163
Designing Biotopia DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
[4,77]. Immersive technologies such as Tree Box promote mindful-
ness in natural settings through embodied interaction [ 61], while
augmented and virtual reality applications expand the possibilities
for environmental learning and engagement [18, 64].
Interactive storytelling also plays a significant role in fostering
more-than-human connections. Workshops and artefacts, such as
Finding Arcadia , use narrative and positive framing to facilitate
emotional engagement with complex climate data, encouraging em-
pathy between humans and more-than-human entities [ 30]. Simi-
larly, initiatives like Hackeanos embrace co-creative and speculative
design to cultivate relationality with the ocean as a dynamic and
interconnected being [25].
Integrating more-than-human perspectives into education, how-
ever, presents distinct challenges. For example, designing digital ex-
periences in natural history museums that resonate with teenagers
requires an understanding of personality traits and behavioural dy-
namics [ 20]. Concurrently, workshops such as Digital Technologies
in Nature surface ethical tensions and design complexities when
deploying technology in ecological contexts, advocating for the
inclusion of local communities and non-human stakeholders alike
[87].
Artistic practices offer yet another dimension for exploring these
interactions. The use of point cloud datasets in art reveals the ex-
pressive potential of remote sensing to engage with theories of new
materialism and entanglement [ 50]. Projects like EdenX exemplify
the blending of artistic and technological approaches to articulate
more-than-human dialogues that address both environmental and
social justice concerns [72].
2.3.2 Transmedia for More-than-human Heritage.
Expanding on the possibilities of exploring different media and
contexts, transmedia storytelling bridges cultural and natural her-
itage through narrative and interaction. As proposed by Jenkins
[52], each individual intervention, exploring different media, is a
possible entry-point to the journey and should contribute with a
different facet of the overall narrative. This structure allows for the
engagement of users with different interests and media literacies,
and the exploration of various aspects of the narrative without
over-complexifying each one. Especially for projects using digi-
tal technologies for diverse audiences (e.g. for schools, museums
and other public spaces), there is great potential for using a mix
of different media for inclusive experiences. However, within HCI
research venues – namely the ACM Digital Library, IEEE, Springer
LNCS, Convergence Journal, and DIGRA, from 2000 to 2024 – we
found very few results related to transmedia for natural heritage
that actually explore more than one medium.
The potential of geostorytelling in transmedia has been explored
[12] by using mobile devices and georeferenced multimedia content
to create emotional and participatory narratives that enhance the
experience of small heritage sites, promoting slow and conscious
tourism. The 3D-Pitoti project uses technologies like augmented
reality, 3D cinema, and virtual exhibitions to showcase Valcamonica
rock engravings, transforming scientific data into engaging, inter-
active cultural experiences for the public [ 53].Bear 71 explores the
intersection of the human and animal worlds through a multimedia
web documentary that maps wildlife encounters [ 62].Fragmentsof Laura integrates mobile virtual reality and location-aware sto-
rytelling to uncover challenges and opportunities for immersive
public experiences [ 26]. Mixed-reality projects like Bitter and Sweet
explore postcolonial narratives of slavery, employing digital sketch-
ing to reveal hidden layers of cultural heritage [28].
Work on technology for nature engagement should integrate
direct and indirect nature experiences, respect cultural diversity,
and foster environmental identity [ 86]. Despite the growing body
of work exploring more-than-human heritage in HCI, existing stud-
ies often focus on specific applications or theoretical frameworks.
This paper proposes an underutilized transmedia experience as an
actionable strategy for bridging posthuman heritage theory with
design practice derived from a detailed, exploratory design process.
Our aim is to propose and illustrate novel approaches to applying
posthuman principles in critical heritage experience design that
represent and consider more-than-human entities and systems.
3 Exploratory Phase: Understanding the
Context and Actors
In this section, we outline the different phases of the design process,
leading to our proposal for designing a more-than-human focused
transmedia experience detailed in section 4. The design of Biotopia is
a culmination of multiple steps meant to better understand different
components of the project and how they could inform the design
of a decentered natureculture experience. Arguably, "posthuman
research is as much about what knowledge is as it is how knowledge
comes to be" [ 83], and so we contribute to these explorations and
debate by carefully presenting and reflecting on each phase of the
work and how they informed the proposed design constructs.
3.1 Initial Field Research: Probing
More-than-human Considerations
The first phase of the LoGa Culture project focused on explor-
ingdifferent facets of the implementation context and theoretical
frameworks (Fig. 2). We started by engaging with visitors of the
sites through self-reports [ 37] and creative probes [ 8] designed
specifically for these natureculture contexts. The probes were de-
veloped as research tools to gather in-depth, subjective data about
participants’ sensory and emotional experiences while visiting the
sites. Drawing on feminist posthuman approaches, these tools cap-
tured natural heritage’s relational and more-than-human aspects,
emphasizing a multi-sensory and embodied engagement [36].
This research identified four main design directions to address
the challenge of balancing over-tourism with conservation efforts
at natural heritage sites [ 36]. These directions are: 1) Cultivating
Empathetic Connections and Holistic Education, which aims to
deepen visitors’ understanding of nature through immersive, mul-
tisensory experiences; 2) Encouraging Collective Stewardship and
Community Resilience, fostering community-driven conservation
efforts by promoting collaborative caretaking and shared steward-
ship through gamified experiences and participatory projects; 3)
Reflecting and Respecting Diverse Narratives and Agencies, high-
lighting the diverse cultural and ecological narratives of the region;
and 4) Fostering Inclusivity and Adaptability in Interconnected

Ecosystems, emphasizing resilient, adaptable designs that accom-
modate diverse visitor needs and dynamic environmental condi-
tions.
The data collected from these tools offered a nuanced under-
standing of visitors’ experiences and the challenges in designing
for these sites.
3.2 Exploratory Field Research: Fostering
More-than-human Connections in Nature
and in a Museum Space
The results from the initial field research inspired further explo-
rations, now more focused on design considerations – first, for the
researchers to explore their connection with the natural environ-
ment in a more immersive manner; second, to better understand
the needs and challenges of the museum implementation context.
3.2.1 Exploratory Noticing and Sketching in Nature.
We felt it was crucial for us as individuals and researchers to better
understand the different actors and their relationships in a closer
and embodied way. Emphasizing the value of situated practices
in nature-related technology design [ 2,3], we used noticing and
sketching in nature as an embodied exploratory practice [ 11,29,
56,76,81] that would help us see beyond our usual experiences
of the Madeira’s natural environment and hopefully guide a more
decentered design approach [ 59,60] with a deeper consideration for
more-than-human entanglements. With this purpose, two authors
(R1 and R2) performed two nature walks in Madeira’s Levadas –water canals first built in the 15th century to take fresh water from
rainy parts of the island to others, now used as nature walk paths.
During the walks, two researchers (the first and second authors –
R1 and R2 respectively) collected field notes and sketches performed
on-location to notice human/nonhuman tensions, their feelings in
different moments of the journey, and their connection or discon-
nection to more-than-humans. These methods were chosen for
their ease and versatility – R1 is a designer and has an affinity for
sketching, while R2, a neuroscientist, prefers the written word. Still,
both researchers engaged with this mixed-method approach so that
each could adapt and explore it freely while following the same
methodology.
By analysing their sketches and reflections, R1 noticed a prefer-
ence for solitude and quiet and an appreciation for simple, intro-
spective moments. These reflective moments allowed R1 to engage
with the natural surroundings fully and facilitated an embodied un-
derstanding of the space. R2, despite finding sketching challenging,
observed that drawing the Levadas made him more aware of the
spatial relationships and specific elements within the landscape.
R2’s suggestion to promote mindfulness and awareness without
overwhelming the senses aligns with R1’s reflections. Both high-
lighted the impact of tourism on the natural setting, acknowledging
its role in transforming the Levadas from serene nature escapes to
busy, human-modified spaces.
Both researchers emphasized various more-than-human ele-
ments that contributed to their experiences. R1 noted interactions
with birds, lizards, water, and flora, emphasizing how the pres-
ence of living organisms shaped her sense of connection to the
165
Designing Biotopia DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
Levadas. For R2, elements like moss, rocks, and water canals were
vital, indicating a blend of natural and man-made features that felt
alive and integral to the experience. These observations suggest
that more-than-human entities play a crucial role in shaping how
people perceive and interact with the Levadas, highlighting the
interconnectedness between human and non-human elements.
3.2.2 Understanding More-than-human Connections in a Museum
Space.
Another important layer to informing the design was to understand
visitors’ experience in the museum related to the representation of
more-than-humans and how to improve and foster these connec-
tions. We also interviewed four experts from two natural history
museums. By understanding the needs and expectations of museum
visitors, alongside the museum’s internal objectives, we aim to iden-
tify opportunities to integrate more-than-human considerations
into the museum’s design and interactions.
Museum Visitors
The purpose of the interviews conducted at the Funchal Natural
History Museum was to gain insights into visitors’ expectations,
experiences, and suggestions for enhancing the museum’s repre-
sentation of the natural heritage of Madeira. One researcher (the
fifth author) casually approached visitors at the museum entrance
and asked them to reply to an anonymous questionnaire composed
of three demographic questions and seven open questions (Annex
1.1). We engaged 19 participants: 13 females and 6 males, ranging
in age from 16 to 69 years old, and an educational background that
varied from basic education (n=4, up to High School level n=4) to
those holding advanced degrees (n=9, Bachelor to PhD n=2). The
respondents were predominantly tourists (n=16), with only a few
residents of Madeira Island (n=3). This demographic information
suggests that the museum attracts a wide range of visitors, both in
age and educational background, most of whom are not residents.
However, the walk-in affluence is low, with the museum relying on
organised visits, mainly from schools.
Responses were thematically analysed [ 17] and discussed among
the authors. Several visitors mentioned a desire for more detailed in-
formation about the species on display, including aspects like their
habitat, diet, and conservation status, as well as suggestions for
integrating modern technologies, such as interactive exhibits and
multimedia presentations, to create a more engaging experience.
Many visitors expressed satisfaction with the museum’s current of-
ferings, particularly the audio elements in the forest-themed room
(the only audio element in the main exhibition space). However,
they also highlighted the need for expanded content, such as addi-
tional species and interactive elements that could appeal to younger
audiences. The interviews reveal a strong interest in interactive
and immersive technologies, particularly related to the museum’s
representation of Madeira’s biodiversity. There was a consensus on
the value of these experiences, such as moving models or digital
projections, and providing guided tours or audio guides to offer
deeper insights into the exhibits.
Cultural Partners
In addition to gathering visitors’ perspectives, we interviewed fourexperts from two natural history museums (Project Cultural Part-
ners) – from Portugal (CP1, CP2) and Germany (CP3, CP4). The
questionnaire was composed of six open questions (Annex 1.2) and
results were also thematically analysed and discussed among the
authors. We aimed to gain insights into the institution’s role in
preserving and communicating more-than-human heritage. Their
insights are particularly valuable as they provide a professional
perspective on the museums’ mission, challenges and potential
areas for improvement.
CP1 emphasized the institution’s core mission to document and
disseminate knowledge about Madeira’s natural heritage through
its extensive scientific collections. They advocated using modern
technologies to enhance visitor engagement and suggested expand-
ing educational resources to foster a deeper connection between
visitors and the exhibits. CP2 also highlighted the museum’s role in
local education, stressing its long-standing integration into school
curricula. They identified areas for improvement, including the
need for more immersive and interactive displays, particularly for
underrepresented species like plants and terrestrial invertebrates.
To bridge this gap, CP2 recommended leveraging digital tools to
provide more engaging and informative experiences for a diverse
audience.
CP3 focused on the institution’s role in preserving and inter-
preting natural heritage through its vast collection of specimens.
They emphasized the museum’s efforts to balance regional and
international biodiversity representation while highlighting the
importance of emotional storytelling and contextual information to
enhance visitor engagement. CP3’s insights suggested that muse-
ums could improve visitor experiences by incorporating narratives
that provide historical and cultural context to the exhibits, thus
fostering a deeper connection between visitors and nature. CP4
highlighted the value of digital interactive options, such as aug-
mented reality (AR) and small games, to engage younger visitors
and enhance interaction with exhibits. They suggest incorporat-
ing questions in media guides and worksheets to promote visitor
reflection and engagement. Additionally, CP4 emphasized the im-
portance of personalized guided tours and the use of AR to improve
accessibility, particularly for younger visitors and those with visual
impairments. Incorporating touch and other sensory experiences
like smell and hearing would create a multi-sensory, immersive
experience.
Connecting these perspectives, it becomes evident that while
museums have strong foundations in education and conservation,
and are appreciated for their collections and thematic focus, they
could benefit from incorporating more interactive and emotion-
ally engaging elements. By using technology-driven strategies and
compelling narratives, museums can enhance their educational im-
pact, promote environmental awareness, and create more dynamic
presentations of natural heritage.
4Biotopia : Designing a More-than-Human
Transmedia Experience
Biotopia , a transmedia experience which strives to connect visitors
with more-than-human perspectives, was inspired by a vision of
thriving coexistence between humans and the more-than-human

world. This multi-context and transmedia experience proposes con-
necting with and representing various local nonhuman actors and
their complex interconnections, fostering links between different
locations and their natural heritage. This work illustrates ways of
"thinking and doing heritage otherwise" [79].
Research-through-design naturally allows for learning and cre-
ating theory through continuous exploration. In line with the idea
ofemergence in design practice, what we learned from each stage
led to a better understanding of the context in which we were op-
erating ( design in settings ) and adaptation to technical affordances
[39]. We also "drifted by intention" [ 54] as some design explorations
demanded a shift of initial ideas to reply to the needs of the contexts
or audiences.
Through this process, we "illuminate the evolving nature of
designing within the more-than-human paradigm" [ 41], and work
towards effective engagement with natureculture and non-human
others through HCI. To accomplish this, we translated the various
theoretical frameworks and results from the exploratory phases
into three inspirational Design Constructs to inform future work:
DC1) Digital Balance ; DC2) Sensory Symbiosis ; DC3) Webs of Life .
We performed four brainstorming workshops with the research
team to ideate how to transform these constructs into practice—two
sessions for the transmedia journey and two sessions focused on
ideating the storytelling component. The first author (R1) further
developed the ideas between each session. We also shared the ideas
with the museum partners at various stages of development to get
their feedback and approval.
We illustrate how these Design Constructs can inspire and in-
form future natureculture work by interpreting them in the design
ofBiotopia . After each of the three design constructs we illustrate
how we applied them in our designs: DC1.1) An Holistic Journey ;
DC1.2) The Levada Companion ; DC1.3) Mindful Use of LLMs ; DC2.1)
On-location vs Remote Embodiment ; DC3.1) MtH Characters and
Narratives ; and DC3.2) A Story of Entanglements . We envision that
this process will contribute to their application by other HCI re-
searchers.4.1 Design Construct 1 – Digital Balance :
Mindful Integration of Technology in
Reflective Visitor Journeys
Inspired by the probes and self-reports, our own noticing activ-
ities, and previous research (e.g. [ 33,86]), this design construct
proposes highlighting the mindful use of technology – essential
when implementing digital experiences in natural contexts.
When working in natural settings, one should prioritize non-
intrusive technologies that harmonize with and respect the sur-
rounding environment. The design needs to iteratively adapt sus-
tainability practices to ensure that technology integration is context-
specific and environmentally mindful.
Furthermore, previous work on transmedia [ 26] indicates the
need to explore structured, meaningful journeys that include differ-
ent moments, balancing action, and reflection. Each moment adds
meaning to the overall experience and can cater to different media
literacies and knowledge levels, ensuring accessibility for various
abilities and backgrounds. Carefully considering the experience
journey can include more or less attention-demanding technolo-
gies depending on the moment’s communication needs and the
context’s considerations.
The overarching aim of this design construct is to respect visitors’
need for stillness, contemplation, and reflection, especially in natu-
ral settings, by minimizing distractions and ensuring technology
enhances rather than detracts from the immersive experience of
each context. At the same time, a well-conceptualised user journey
with different interaction moments can still reply to the project’s
information and interaction needs without detracting from the
environment. It also avoids fragmented or overwhelming visitor
experiences by balancing actively engaging moments with spaces
for personal observation and meaning-making.
4.1.1 Digital Balance in Biotopia (DC1.1): An Holistic Journey .
Considering the possibility of exploring multiple implementation
locations with very different characteristics and demands, we de-
cided to create a transmedia experience with a well-defined, albeit
flexible, journey composed of several moments – each bringing a
167
Designing Biotopia DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
Figure 4: Biotopia trasmedia journey design: The three contexts of implementation of the transmedia experience: 1) In Nature
(Levadas), 2) Museum Space (the permanent exhibition), and 3) Museum Room (a room exclusively dedicated to the interactive
experience). Each of the three moments are accompanied by some of the conceptual aspects considered while designing the
experience and, in green, the Design Constructs (DC) applied.
different layer of meaning to the experience.The overarching nar-
rative becomes more complete and engaging with each moment.
The various artefacts can be experienced independently and in any
order, allowing for a flexible transition between sites. The very
different nature of each context and the physical distance between
the museum and the Levadas help avoid possible dissonance when
transitioning between the various experiences.
The transmedia experience is, therefore, divided into three arte-
facts (Fig. 4). The first is the Levada Companion [42] that focuses on
"experiencing" – engagement with the MtHs through an embodiedand sensorial interaction. In nature , we propose a technological so-
lution that requires little interaction with the device. This mode of
interaction was devised to not detract from nature. The experience
facilitates a "direct dialogue" with more-than-humans in a subtle,
non-intrusive manner (details in 4.1.2). On the other hand, with the
second artefact in the museum space – the MtH Dialogues – we pro-
pose an alternative approach to dialoguing with the MtHs. Using a
large-language model (LLM), we facilitate "fictional dialogues" with
four of the collections’ more-than-human entities. Inspired by Ben-
ford et al.’s [ 7] work that proposed an emotional journey through
a museum’s collection to add layers of emotional content to the
168
DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal Ferreira, et al.
exhibits and a physical postcard for further reflection, we invite vis-
itors to take a map that guides them through the museum collection
to learn about the MtHs and collect tokens to open an extra feature
in the room installation. The visitors impersonate characters de-
pending on the adventure they choose (e.g. an explorer, an animal,
a time-traveller). We saw the museum exhibition as a context that
permitted the exploration of more attention-demanding technol-
ogy solutions with a more ludic experience with the species when
compared to the natural environment. These interactive solutions
also add new layers of experience and meaning to the traditional
exhibition format of the taxidermy animals (Fig. 3-B) characterized
by high scientific value but low engagement for visitors. This arte-
fact is focused on "learning" – enhancing visitors’ knowledge and
ecological literacy through MtH empathy. Finally, the third artefact
– the MtH Entanglement Map – aims to "change perspectives" by
decentering the heritage narrative and show the complexity of MtH
entanglements. For the museum room , we designed a multisensory
experience with screens, a controlling console, and decoration that
represents different natural environments through light and sound.
This artefact revolves around two interactive entanglement stories
(4.3.2) with the MtHs as protagonists (4.3.1). The story is explored
through multiple moments of interactive exploration that dive into
the entity’s perspectives and connections. We strive to incentivize
reflection through playful interactions.
Each implementation space affords different ethical considera-
tions and modes of technological exploration in or about nature,
guiding very different forms of representing and connecting with
MtHs – some more experiential, some more informative, and all
working together as a cohesive experience.
4.1.2 Digital Balance in Biotopia (DC1.2): The Levada Compan-
ion.
To respect visitors’ contemplative experiences in nature, we
decided to use minimal and non-intrusive technological solutions in
this implementation context. Interestingly, this decision contradicts
our initial ideas, as we hypothesized implementing more complex
games and mechanics during the nature walks. Still, we revised this
approach based on the exploratory research results. In the case of
theLevadas , people tend to want to be immersed in nature. They are
not keen to have more digital "interference". Therefore, building on
R7’s previous experiments, we propose a device that allows visitors
to the natural site to "dialogue" with some species in a less intrusive
manner.
The Levada companion is a compact arm wearable designed to
minimise its impact on visitors’ walks and their experience of nature.
Its waterproof materials, discreet green colour, and simplicity of
use, with only two buttons, ensure wearability in any weather
and environment. The device’s design moves away from traditional
technological cues (such as screens and vibrations), fully immersing
the wearer in the Levadas’ environment. Connected through GPS
to a static database of species geolocation based on scientists’ and
volunteers’ observations, the device will leverage diverse sensory
stimuli (touch and vision) to let the wearer know they’ve entered
another being’s area or ‘contact zone’. Tactile stimuli are tailored
to each species to deepen the visitors’ connection with that specific
animal. Once in a contact zone, a speaker activates, allowing thewearer to play the species call by pressing a button to engage
in multispecies dialogues. The device’s emphasis on sensory-rich
multispecies interactions (through sound, touch, and vision) allows
visitors to experience nature from different perspectives, fostering
a deeper connection with a specific ecosystem. The mechanics of
this interaction can foster stillness and reflection by inviting users
to observe more closely.
4.1.3 Digital Balance in Biotopia (DC1.3): Mindful Use of LLMs .
In recent years, LLMs have developed as a crucial AI technol-
ogy supporting intelligent chatbots in various application settings.
However, integrating LLMs introduces unpredictability and uncon-
trollability into current dialogue-based interactions. The generated
content from LLMs includes aspects like outdated recommenda-
tions, which are limited by the static training dataset, knowledge
from non-authoritative sources, and information that could be in-
accurate and fabricated. These points become unacceptable in rig-
orous scientific and educational contexts, such as Natural History
Museums—our implementation context.
With this in mind, we designed our dialogue system leveraging
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This technique does not
require costly resources to retrain the LLMs, achieving preferen-
tial information retrieval from authoritative sources of knowledge
prepared by the researchers. Together with the LLMs’ paraphras-
ing ability, our dialogue system realized the goal of giving users
playful feedback, digestible (e.g., by rephrasing a dry scientific pre-
sentation colloquial) and, most importantly, rigorously traceable.
Furthermore, we believe this greater transparency in the source of
generated information will improve the public’s trustworthiness of
AI-based dialogue systems (Fig. 6–2). We also used an open-source
LLM running locally to reduce the technology’s environmental
impact.
4.2 Design Construct 2 – Sensory Symbiosis :
Multisensory and Embodied Storytelling
From the feedback of nature and museum visitors and previous
work on more-than-human HCI [ 49,83], we point to the potential
of developing immersive, multisensory experiences that engage
visitors emotionally and empathetically with more-than-human
heritage. These experiences can explore embodied approaches, such
as interactive sensory elements, to deepen understanding of eco-
logical systems. When applied to museum spaces, this construct
also addresses the cultural partners’ need for interactive, engaging
and informative experiences.
Designers should strive to meaningfully use the media choices
to represent more-than-human perspectives – for example, through
participatory and sensory methods that allow visitors to “step into
the world” of more-than-human entities (e.g., feeling temperature
changes, hearing species’ sounds, or experiencing simulated in-
terdependencies). Ultimately, these strategies strive to overcome
emotional disconnection between visitors and natural heritage by
fostering embodied, multisensory interactions based on compelling
narratives. These lead to inclusive and innovative engagement
methods that invite diverse visitor participation. Immersive story-
telling can make more-than-human entities tangible and relatable,
169
Designing Biotopia DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
enabling visitors to empathize with them and enhance their under-
standing of ecological relationships.
4.2.1 Sensory Symbiosis in Biotopia (DC2.1): On-location vs Re-
mote Embodiment .
We explored two embodied approaches: on-location, in the Lev-
adas, and remote, in the museum room. Being physically in nature
differs from being in a room inspired by nature. Adapted to the
implementation contexts, we developed different strategies to en-
hance the sense of embodiment and bring about alternative forms
of MtH connection.
The Levada companion highlights the embodied experience of
being in nature by aligning the visitor’s presence with that of a MtH.
By pointing to this possible proximity and facilitating the means
for connection, the artefact opens up the opportunity for pause and
reflection, making the human closer and more conscious of their
environment. It uses the already immersive natural surroundings
to add a layer of experiential meaning.
In the museum room, we wanted to link to the embodied ex-
perience of being in nature to enhance the engagement with the
interactive story. We did this by designing a space inspired by nat-
ural environments (ocean and forest) that is visually very different
from the remaining museum and gives a sense of entering a dif-
ferent world (Fig. 6). The intention was not to "replace" natural
encounters inside the room walls, as warned by [ 87], but to use a
sensorial and tangible experience to bring out a sense of wonder
that would give meaning to the more-than-human heritage infor-
mation being shown. The immersive environment is composed of
nature sounds, digital visuals, and exhibition design inspired by
plants and algae that change their look through different coloured
lights – e.g. blue for ocean ecosystems, green for forests, red for
volcanic environments.
4.3 Design Construct 3 – Webs of Life : Ecological
Interconnectedness and More-Than-Human
Narratives
Inspired by HCI previous work that advocates for inclusive ap-
proaches (e.g. [ 55,66]), and our exploratory research in nature,
this design construct focuses on developing empathic more-than-
human narratives by drawing attention to the relationships and
interdependencies within ecosystems, such as the connection be-
tween water, flora, humans and fauna. These proposals encourage
collective stewardship by involving visitors in diverse and inclusive
narratives – a need derived from the probes and self-reports.
Encouraging people to feel connected to natural systems – a
part of them but also responsible for them – can be accomplished
through participatory narratives and gamified interactions that
promote empathy for more-than-human entities and highlight the
entanglements between humans and the environment, inviting
visitors to explore and question relationships. Expanding on this
argument, the aim is to work towards eliminating these divisions
(natureculture) and guiding visitors to see themselves as part of
nature.Design directions should work towards encouraging visitors to
engage with inclusive narratives through subtle cues and open-
ended exploration, allowing for personal meaning-making while
respecting the dynamic character and complexity of nature. These
explorations expand the scope of AHD by deeply considering and
representing more-than-human narratives in traditional heritage
experiences. It also explores the need to engage non-expert audi-
ences with scientific topics through storytelling [ 23]. This design
construct addresses the museum partners’ needs for alternative,
more engaging and detailed stories about species and ecosystems,
fostering collective engagement by putting the audience as a part
of a complex and interdependent ecosystem.
4.3.1 Webs of Life in Biotopia (DC3.1): MtH Characters and Nar-
ratives .
Informed by the museum’s collection, we selected five MtH enti-
ties representing different aspects of Madeira’s natural heritage and
allowing for exploring human/more-than-human entanglements
(Fig. 5).
We started by selecting two "emblematic" species of the island:
the Mediterranean monk seal and the Zino’s petrel. The first inhab-
its a coastal marine ecosystem. The second is a seabird that lives
in the central mountainous areas of the island and travels to the
open sea (high mountain and deep-sea ecosystems). To complement
these species, we selected two others that inhabit mid-altitude for-
est ecosystems and are typically regarded as "less popular". The
Trocaz pigeon is endemic to Madeira and lives in the laurel forests.
Interestingly, it is not well-loved by some humans as it sometimes
feeds off farmers’ crops, but it is fundamental for its ecosystem as it
disperses the seeds of the laurel forest trees. On the other hand, the
Iberian green frog was introduced to Madeira by humans, bringing
up the question of human interference in natural habitats. This,
allied with inhabiting the human-made water canals, illustrates the
complexities of natureculture. Both these species brought interest-
ing tensions to the more-than-human heritage discourse. Finally, as
a non-living entity, the volcanic rock introduced a distinct nuance
to the experience. For example, we saw exciting temporal oppor-
tunities, allowing to link visitors with the concept of deeptime
and make them question their place in these more-than-human
temporalities.
We explore two very different approaches to representing the
MtHs in the transmedia experience (Fig. 5-3). In the Levada Com-
panion , there is no character development and the interaction with
a wild animal in their own language and habitat are the main as-
pects of the interaction. In contrast, in the museum artefacts, we
create anthropomorphic characters to make use of narrative con-
ventions and structures to convey specific information but also
draw on empathy and narrative transportation – the feeling of
being completely immersed in the world of a narrative. The bi-
ological and behavioural characteristics of each entity are used
to inform the traits of their fictional characters. This selection of
MtHs brought diversity and versatility to the transmedia narrative,
making the information flow entertaining but based on accurate
scientific information. Furthermore, the different MtH representa-
tions afforded by the transmedia experience allow us to explore
contrasting strategies.

Figure 5: Biotopia trasmedia narrative design: This figure visually summarizes the different elements considered in developing
the narrative journey and storytelling. 1) First, we settled on the main aim of the narrative. 2) Then, we selected the more-
than-human characters considering their habitats and usual movements (diversity and connections/entanglements to explore):
Pigeon (P), Monk Seal (S), Zino’s Petrel (Z), Vulcanic Rock (R) and Frog (F). 3) We settled on which characters to explore in each
of the experience’s artefacts and some considerations taken for each particular story section/context. 4) Finally, we created two
stories each with several of the characters, based on planned hero’s journeys for the protagonists. The Design Constructs (DC)
are marked in green to illustrate where they were considered.
The characters are presented through two narrative mechanics
mediated by digital technologies. In the museum space, the open-
ended nature of the stories created with the LLM dialogue feature
is adaptable to the visitor’s own interests while also being ludic
and informative. With a different narrative strategy, the immersive
room installation uses two stories with a MtH as the protagonist
and others as characters. These stories follow the hero’s journey
structure to give an emotional base to the natural heritage infor-
mation (Fig. 5-4) – about the species, ecosystems and conservation
efforts – which the visitor can explore in key interactive moments.These interactive narratives expand the museum’s offerings with
empathetic and informative experiences about the species on dis-
play.
4.3.2 Webs of Life in Biotopia (DC3.2): A Story of Entanglements .
Expanding the museum’s natural heritage discourses led to the
conceptualization of a story of entanglements with the five MtHs
as the main vectors. By exploring the complexity of Madeira’s
171
Designing Biotopia DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
ecosystems, we intend to foster decentered thinking through a
deeper sense of our interconnectedness and interdependencies with
more than humans.
Our inspirational starting point was a wooden, table-sized map of
Madeira, a centerpiece of the museum’s permanent exhibition (Fig.
3-C). We interpreted this map as an Anthropocentric and reductive
point-of-view regarding the island’s complex and dynamic natural
heritage. Considering the potential that the museum’s diverse col-
lection presents, and intending to bring posthuman narratives to the
heritage discourse, we decided to design a complexity-embracing
point-of-view of natureculture. This MtH Entanglement map is
designed to explore the connections between human and more-
than-human actors. We changed the viewpoint to a lateral cut of
the island (Fig. 5-2) to also show the massive underwater area that
is part of Madeira but usually ignored. In this representation, land
and ocean are intrinsically connected.
As mentioned in the previous section, the five MtHs were se-
lected for their diversity in terms of physical characteristics and,
importantly, usual habitat and opportunities for connections with
the other entities. The two stories have been written to highlight
entanglements through fictional journeys that also link to recent
environmental events—for example, last summer’s forest fires, how
they affect humans and more-than-humans, and how humans and
more-than-humans are crucial for the forest’s regeneration (exam-
ple in Fig. 5-4).
5 Discussion
By detailing our RtD approach, we contribute to ongoing research
linking more-than-human heritage and HCI practice-based work.
Our process illustrates how posthuman theory and exploratory
research can inform the design of interactive natureculture experi-
ences in real-world implementations. The three design constructs
proposed and how they inspired and informed the design of Biotopia
demonstrate the value of each step of the design process for criti-
cal HCI research. In this section, we reflect on our design journey
to discuss how the work sits within current critical heritage and
posthuman HCI explorations. We also incorporate considerations
discussed with the Portuguese and German cultural partners while
presenting the final designs.
5.1 Reflections on Posthuman
Research-through-Design
Calls to move design processes beyond human exceptionalism and
human-centric approaches are not new in HCI [ 31,32]. However,
how to apply these proposals in real-world design is continuously
being explored. We align with Nicenboim et al’s argument that
decentering practices must "be entangled with the activities, tools,
and daily challenges of design processes" [ 66]. How to “decenter
through design” and think beyond user-centred methods towards
more inclusive ones has been one of the main challenges of this re-
search. An example of how we materialized these ideas is the Levada
companion artefact. Our design decisions considered the animal’s
needs and the "functionality" of the device. In our concept, the
interaction does not need to "work" in a traditional usability sense.
A no-resolution (not having a reply from the contacted species) is
part of the interaction design, not a flaw. This exercise is meant tocreate a connection between the human and the animal, but it is
also meant to educate the user that we do not control these interac-
tions, nor should we attempt to. In line with our intention, one of
the partners suggested that the tool could be an educational tool to
teach people about nature conservation. Also, for ethical reasons,
it should not be used excessively so as not to disturb the animals.
We build on previous work exploring cohabitation in practice [ 22]
through the design of forms of interaction that unite contained and
serendipitous interactivity with respect towards the multiple actors
involved (human and more-than-human).
Another crucial aspect in our process has been questioning how
to explore HCI to go beyond restrictive human-meaning-making
perspectives [ 34]. We built on evolving methodologies that con-
nect theoretical ideas with lived experiences [ 1] and help designers
connect with and interpret natural spaces and more-than-human
relations [ 9,29,60,71] to guide us in understanding the partic-
ularities of the context in which we are intervening. R2, despite
finding sketching challenging, observed that drawing the Levadas
made him more aware of the spatial relationships and specific el-
ements within the landscape, which traditional cultural probes
hadn’t captured as effectively. This act of sketching, despite its
difficulty, encouraged him to engage with the physicality of the
trail in a more exploratory manner, suggesting that such activities
can help break conventional modes of interaction and foster new
ways of perceiving space and build situated knowledges [83].
The designs we create are inevitably moulded by our biases, and,
as we pointed out regularly throughout our process, our perspec-
tives are always relational and situated [ 41]. There are no universal
methods for posthuman design, and that is why it is crucial to
present and debate the rationale that guides these design experi-
ments.
5.2 Tensions in More-than-human Interactions
and Representation
When designing an intervention that connects visitors with wild an-
imals, we tried to base our approach on "humility and cohabitation",
being acutely aware of the dangers of "exploitation of nonhuman
species" [ 84] in our design. Initially, we thought of building the dia-
logue with the Zino’s Petrel, a more emblematic bird on the island.
However, this endangered species lives in secluded habitats high in
the mountains. We decided to work with more approachable species
for the animal’s protection and the visitor’s safety in a, hopefully,
non-invasive deployment. Here, we considered Webber et al.’s [ 87]
ethical tensions when designing in natural spaces. Still, our team
has continuously discussed these considerations, and we intend to
build on them as the work progresses. In alignment with our ethical
debates, both the German and Portuguese partners emphasized
the importance of respecting the animals and their environment
– on the one hand, discussing the importance of considering the
potential impact of the animal call on other species, and on the
other, the need to respect spatial distances.
Contrary to our expectations, none of the partners expressed con-
cerns about using LLMs, anthropomorphized characters or fictional
stories to present the MtHs, affirming that the audience understands
the nature of these communication strategies and that it all depends

on the purpose of each artefact. One partner highlighted the im-
portance of scientific accuracy in the LLM responses and biological
accuracy when developing character traits for species representa-
tions – aspects that we have already carefully addressed. Together
with the Levada Companion, we worked towards using the different
artefacts of the transmedia experience to explore diverse strategies
to represent and engage with more-than-humans.
Through continuous iterations and improvements of the arte-
facts, we are considering "the long-term environmental or social
consequences of the products and systems" [ 41] we are developingbut with the open realization that our approach is inherently limited.
The debate on these issues within the HCI community is crucial for
the collective evolution of sustainable and ethical design processes
and we hope this research contributes to it. The importance of mul-
tidisciplinarity and multiple worldviews in building more inclusive
and sustainable design processes is also key [ 1]. Our close collabo-
ration with the culture partners’ team, which includes biologists,
science museum curators and communicators, allowed us to inte-
grate insights from different disciplines to account for the welfare
and needs of wildlife [ 87]. Still, being based on the global north, we

see the need to include other perspectives apart from our own. Our
work acknowledges the roles and interdependencies of humans and
nonhumans in shaping worlds and futures [ 1]. However, R1 rec-
ognizes the discomfort of how some pluriversal worldviews push
against hard-set biases of her Western-based ways of thinking and
user-centred design methodologies. This paper illustrates how she
and the team replied to these crucial challenges and incrementally
reflected them in their design practices. We humbly acknowledge
that we have a long way to go and that each experiment is a step
in the right direction.
5.3 Critical Heritage Discourses as a Posthuman
Endeavor
The narratives we propose for more-than-human heritage extend
on previous HCI explorations on MtH connections [ 25,30]. Our
design concepts replied to the challenge of converging posthu-
manism andpost-anthropocentrism ideals [ 15] to expand Madeira’s
heritage discourses in a decentered direction. By focusing the nar-
rative on MtHs and building the heritage narrative around them,
we are attempting to contradict human exceptionalism in heritage
discourses. However, this approach needs to build interest in the
heritage information. We addressed this balance by focusing on the
entanglements of humans and non-humans – how we are not at
the centre of any natural hierarchy and MtH’s are crucial for our
and the environment’s well-being.
As proposed by Sterling [ 79], our detailed process demonstrates
the diverse and critical considerations discussed for the various
‘components’ that form heritage . Each of these design decisions
influences the heritage narrative and we strived to build discourses
that are inclusive and reparative. As the construct of natureculture
proposes [ 34], landscapes, archaeological sites, and ecosystems are
interconnected and should not be treated as separate fields. This
proposal became the cornerstone of our design concept. In Biotopia ,
we worked towards merging ’nature’ (MtHs) and ’culture’ (the
man-made canals) for critical heritage where both constructs are
equally defining of Madeira’s heritage. We interpreted the sites as
assemblages of multiple actors [34].
The Levadas are an example of "a landscape constructed through
the human gaze" that "colonizes nature and materiality by depriving
materiality and a range of naturalized others of an active role in the
co-creation of events" [34]. These tensions demand a critical analysis
and consideration when creating interventions for these naturecul-
ture contexts. Our designs reply to critical heritage’s purpose of
questioning traditional ways of doing heritage [ 19] while, at the
same time, testing how open to these strategies a heritage insti-
tution – a natural history museum – would be. Madeira’s natural
heritage is intrinsically linked to Portuguese colonization. Despite
the island not being inhabited by humans prior to the Portuguese
arrival, the subsequent human presence shaped the natural envi-
ronment. The choice of species is meant to explore these tensions.
When discussing the species chosen, one of the museum’s partners
questioned the choice of the frog, mentioning it is not an endemic
species. But after we explained that it was precisely for that reason
that it was selected, they agreed on the interesting points it raised.
In their view, the five species naturally couldn’t represent the whole
diversity of the island, but the selection was appropriate to givea broad view of the complex ecosystems. Furthermore, they high-
lighted the importance of these modern technological solutions
to make Madeira’s natural heritage more accessible and appealing
to a 21st-century audience and to inform the museum’s curatorial
future.
5.4 Limitations and Future Work
This research is intrinsically moulded by the researchers’ expe-
riences, worldviews and areas of practice. We see great value in
expanding this work by involving researchers with varying and
contrasting perspectives.
This paper contributes to the HCI community with the design
process of the natureculture artefacts and the crucial reasoning be-
hind theoretical, conceptual and interaction decisions. Our research
highlights the need for continuous discussions on the work and
ethical considerations implemented in the design. Next, the project
will enter the crucial phase of testing in the various contexts and
with diverse user groups. This next phase will further inform these
design directions.
6 Conclusion
This research explores the intersection of critical heritage and
posthuman HCI, demonstrating how theoretical proposals and ex-
ploratory research inspire and inform the design of an HCI-based
transmedia experience for more-than-human heritage.
The design process underwent various phases, each based on
the previous one. First, through exploratory research, we worked
towards understanding the multiple facets and actors in the spaces
we were intervening in. This phase led to several insights that were
compiled in three Design Constructs for natureculture heritage
design: 1) Digital Balance – Mindful Integration of Technology in
Reflective Visitor Journeys; 2) Sensory Symbiosis : Multisensory and
Embodied Storytelling; and 3) Webs of Life : Ecological Interconnect-
edness and More-Than-Human Narratives. We then describe how
these design constructs were translated in the design of Biotopia , a
transmedia experience for more-than-human heritage. The trans-
media journey connects three sites – nature walks, the museum
collection and a museum room installation – through a narrative
centered on human/non-human entanglements.
We contribute to the HCI community by discussing the design de-
cisions for three interactive artefacts combined into a cohesive trans-
media journey that embody posthuman theories, more-than-human
considerations and decentering practices. This research-through-
design highlights the challenges and opportunities in translating
these propositions in real-world applications, balancing the evo-
lution of more inclusive ways of thinking and doing design away
from user-centred paradigms, with the needs and constraints of
cultural institutions and diverse audience groups. We hope our
work contributes to crucial discussions on decentering HCI design
practices and posthuman ways of thinking.
