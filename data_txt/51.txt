ABSTRACT
To expand the discourse on non-utilitarian values in HCI and Design, 
this pictorial explores the concept of Life-Synchronized Products 
(LSPs), domestic technologies that align lifecycles with users. 
Through a co-design workshop, we developed property dimensions 
for products whose lifetime is associated with users. We defined LSP 
from properties in the dimension and exemplify LSP through ‘LO (Life-
synchronized Oven),’ an oven that lives along with its user and ceases 
to exist upon death. LO features a visual interface, Thread of Life, 
reflecting lifetime and meaningful events, demonstrating physical and 
intelligent growth, expressing thoughts and emotions, and leaving no 
trace after termination. Expert interviews with our research artifacts including a semi-functional prototype, service website, and design 
fiction video revealed that LO can transcend traditional utilitarian 
roles to become “life companions” that foster existential reflection. 
We discuss the technical, business, and socio-ethical challenges of 
LSPs and implications for HCI and design research.

INTRODUCTION
Domestic technologies, including smart homes and appliances, 
have traditionally been perceived as tools designed to address 
everyday chores, emphasizing utility and performance. However, 
advancements in IoT and AI are transforming their potential, enabling 
them to adopt alternative roles and meanings in daily life. For 
instance, speculative projects like Areca [11], Morse Things [58] , and Olo Radio [40] have portrayed products as cohabitants, embodying 
relational and existential roles. Media such as the film Her [52] 
further envisions technologies playing the role of a romantic partner. 
Market ready service robot platforms like Ballie [50] and GR00T [19] 
demonstrate the potential for technologies to live alongside humans 
as intelligent entities, bridging utility and companionship. These 
examples underscore a broader trend of domestic technologies 
coexisting symbiotically with humans. Given this growing shift, it is 
critical to explore their potential to transcend functional origins and 
engage with deeper dimensions of human experience.
One promising avenue for exploration in evolving domestic 
technologies lies in their potential to remind humans of meaningful 
values and guide them toward more purposeful lives. This 
perspective aligns with longstanding interests in the HCI and DIS 
communities, which have consistently investigated alternative, non-
utilitarian values that technologies can pursue. For example, prior 
studies have emphasized designing for emotional experiences 
that foster meaningful connections [21,41] and explored reflective 
technologies aimed at promoting self-awareness and introspection 
[4,55]. Additionally, Existential HCI has examined how interactive  This work is licensed under  Creative Commons Attribution International 4.0.

technologies engage users with existential questions, such as 
meaning, identity, and personal growth, reshaping attitudes toward 
life’s deeper concerns [22]. While these explorations have laid the 
groundwork by defining conceptual frameworks, mainstream 
design practices still largely prioritize efficiency, functionality, and 
performance. There remains a lack of design cases that emphasize 
alternative values and demonstrate how they can be integrated 
into daily contexts, underscoring the need for further research and 
concrete examples.    
This pictorial introduces the concept of Life-Synchronized Products 
(LSPs) - domestic technologies that align their lifecycle with users - 
promoting reflection on life’s finitude, the value of tracelessness, and 
symbiosis. As an example of LSPs, we present LO (Life-Synchronized 
Oven), a speculative smart oven that is born with the user’s DNA, live 
alongside them, and age, ultimately reaching the end of its life at the 
same moment as the user. Throughout its lifespan, LO emphasizes 
the importance of living with an awareness of finite resources, the 
present time, and life itself through a series of integrated features. 
These features include the Thread of Life interface that symbolically 
represents the finite journey of life; Adaptive Growth, enabling LO 
to physically and intellectually evolve alongside the user over time; 
Lifelike Expression, allowing LO to convey consciousness, thoughts, 
and emotions through multi-sensory organs; Simultaneous Cessation, 
ensuring that LO’s hardware and software disappear without a trace 
at the end of the user’s life.
Through a research-through-design approach, this study addresses 
the following research questions: What property dimensions exist in 
domestic appliances whose lifetime is associated with their users? 
How might a home appliance that synchronizes their lifecycle with 
users influence users’ awareness of life’s finitude and uniqueness, 
fostering deeper self reflection? Finally, what technical, business, 
and socio-ethical challenges arise in the process of realizing such 
a concept as a product? To address these questions, this study 
began by exploring property dimensions of life-associated objects 
through a co-design workshop. Using the property dimensions, LO 
was designed through a semi-functional prototype, a service website, 
and a design fiction video. In-depth interviews were conducted with 
10 design experts, utilizing LO’s research artifacts to identify the 
potential impacts of LSPs, and technical, business, and socio-ethical 
challenges associated with their realization.
The contributions of this pictorial are threefold. First, it introduces 
the concept of Life-Synchronized Products, while identifying key 
property dimensions of life associated objects for further exploration. 
Second, it presents LO as a speculative design example, detailing its design rationale. Finally, the study reveals the potential of LSPs 
through expert interviews, highlighting their potential to transcend 
functional domestic technologies and promote existential reflection 
and meaningful living.
RELATED WORKS  
Non-Utilitarian Values in HCI
HCI and design researchers have long explored non-utilitarian 
values, moving beyond traditional focuses on utility and efficiency 
to emphasize emotional and eudemonic experiences. Theories such 
as Emotional Design [38], Ludic Design [20], Reflective Design [51], 
Adversarial Design [16] and Positive Design [14] have highlighted 
the importance of values like aesthetics, self-reflection, mindfulness, 
mental well-being and meaning-making [37]. More recent work in 
More-than-human design [56] has further broadened this perspective, 
integrating ecological awareness and symbiotic values into the 
discourse [5, 27, 60].
A framework within this line of research, Slow Technology [24, 42], 
conceptually aligns with the goals of this study. Slow Technology 
investigates long-term human-technology relationships, focusing 
on reflection, temporal awareness, and enriched environments. 
Building on this, Odom et al. [43] articulated specific qualities such 
as implicit slowness and temporal interconnectedness, enhancing 
the understanding of how time and reflection can be integrated into 
design. Similarly, the existential HCI perspective [29, 30] emphasizes 
how technologies can engage with fundamental aspects of life, such 
as identity, mortality, and meaning. This body of research has explored 
themes like life’s impermanence, digital afterlife, and shared mortality, 
particularly in areas of digital legacy, memorialization, and ephemeral 
design [2]. Our study extends these frameworks by introducing the 
concept of Life- Synchronized Products (LSPs), which embody these 
existential values in the context of everyday domestic technologies.
Alternative Roles and Metaphors of Domestic 
Technology
Researchers have explored alternative roles and values of domestic 
technologies. HCI researchers presented how domestic technologies 
can move beyond functional tools to embody relational, emotional, 
and cultural significance [42, 44, 46]. One notable change is that 
the concept of “thing” has also evolved significantly due to the 
advancement of technology [15, 58, 59]. For instance, from Norman’s 
functional perspective on objects used in daily life [39] to Wakkary’s 
focus on nonhuman entities created by both human and nonhuman 
interactions [57], things becoming to emphasize their agency and 
relationally [7, 54]. Examples include Message Rituals [47] and Odd Interpreters [13]. 
New metaphors and roles have emerged to describe human-
technology relationships. Previous studies often used metaphors 
such as human companion, servant or pet to highlight the emotional 
relationships of these technologies [33, 48, 49]. Discussions around 
animism [35, 36] and object-oriented ontology [18, 25] have further 
emphasized the importance of viewing technologies as relational 
entities rather than mere tools. This study differentiates itself from 
prior works by proposing Life-Synchronized Products (LSPs), which 
are designed as irreplaceable life companions throughout their lives.
Finitude, Longevity, and Trace as Design Materials
The concepts of finitude and ephemerality have been explored 
in design to enhance the emotional and aesthetic experiences of 
technologies [17]. For instance, the Obscura 1C Digital Camera 
[46] embodies ephemerality by requiring its destruction to access 
stored data, turning disappearance into a central design feature [45]. 
Similarly, muRedder [32] explores ephemerality through a speaker 
that shreds physical music media as it plays, creating a one-time, 
unrepeatable auditory experience [31]. While these works focus on the 
technological dissolution as a design feature, our study advances this 
concept by framing it as a symbolic representation of life’s finitude 
and proposing products that completely vanish alongside their users, 
offering another perspective on ephemerality in design.
Our work also reimagines longevity and durability in product design. 
Chapman’s emotional durability framework emphasizes how 
products can foster emotional attachment and accrue meaning 
through use [9]. For example, the Long Living Chair [47] visualizes its 
manufacturing and usage history, encouraging deeper user-object 
connections through digital memory [46]. Life-logging and quantified-
self research are also relevant, as they emphasize the continuous 
visualization of life data for self-reflection. However, these approaches 
often focus on capturing and analyzing shorter music media as it 
plays, creating a one-time, unrepeatable auditory shorter time span 
compared to our study. Projects like Photobox [42], Chronoscope [10], 
and Slide2Remember [33] illustrate how digital artifacts support long-
term reflective engagement [10, 32, 42]. Expanding on these ideas, 
OLO Radio [41] explores meaningful interactions with ephemeral 
media, such as music streaming [40]. This study extends these 
traditions by positioning finitude, disappearance, and longevity as 
core design elements, enabling technologies to embody existential 
values and foster deeper reflections on life’s impermanence.

DIMENSIONS OF LIFE ASSOCIATED OBJECTS
Goal and Method
To identify the property dimensions of life-associated objects and 
apply them in the design of Life-Synchronized Products (LSPs), we 
conducted a co-design workshop involving seven professionals with 
over ten years of experience in creative industries. The participants 
included critical design researchers, retail creative directors, 
experimental animators, illustrators, and film directors. 
The workshop was structured into three sessions (totaling 240 
minutes): (1) initial product exploration, and (2) detailed lifecycle 
specification (3)group discussion. In the first session, participants were 
asked to conceptualize and visualize two products that they considered 
most appropriate as life-associated objects. They explored potential 
features that might emerge when products are associated with users’ 
lifecycles. To support this exploration, we provided a set of technology 
reference cards containing relevant examples. Using these cards, 
participants specified the characteristics of their selected products, 
documented their rationale for selection, and sketched key features.  
In the second session, participants constructed detailed interaction 
scenarios spanning the entire product lifecycle, from birth to 
termination. Using a vertical line as a reference timeline, they mapped 
various lifecycle events experienced by both the product and the user. 
They also illustrated how product functionalities and interactions 
could evolve over time. At the endpoint of the timeline, participants 
described the processes for managing the product’s end-of-life in 
relation to the user’s death. 
The workshop concluded with a group discussion to clarify the 
underlying concepts and rationales of ideas and to reflect on the 
distinctive characteristics of life-associated products. This session 
was video recorded for subsequent thematic analysis. The workshop 
outputs, such as annotated notes and sketches, were also used to 
identify the property dimensions of objects that can be associated 
with users’ lifecycles.
Property Dimensions Characterizing the Relationship 
Between Products and Their Users
The workshop yielded 14 example cases of products associated with 
users’ lifecycles (Figure 1). These included:
1. Life Clock: A personalized biological timepiece designed using 
the user’s DNA data, visualizing the individual’s unique biological 
rhythm over time.
2. Toy Car: An interactive toy car that transmits patterns of play Figure 1. Example design outcomes from the co-design workshop
and internal transformations of the user over time. play across

10. Cleaning Tool: A cleaning implement that visually expresses 
the passage of time through changes in color and form, aging 
alongside its user.
11. Jewelry:  Jewelry crafted through traditional artisanal techniques, 
symbolizing emotional and cultural continuity across generations.
12. Family Photo Album: A visual archive that As older albums 
degrade, selected memories are automatically inherited by the 
next generation.
13. Disposable Smart Patch: A short-term wearable device designed 
for specific health monitoring purposes, with a predefined and 
limited operational lifespan.
14. Self-Destructive Smartphone:  A smartphone that remotely 
disables itself and erases data when lost.
Through the analysis of group discussion, diverse product concepts 
and lifecycle scenarios of the workshop, we identified key dimensions 
characterizing the relationship between products and their users 
(Figure 2). We examined product features and their user interactions 
across different life stages. The first dimension, Life alignment,

revealed three patterns. First, products synchronized with the user’s 
entire lifetime, such as our concept of the smart diary and the mirror 
that evolve with users, creating emotional bonds. Second, products 
sharing a portion of the user’s lifetime, like the chair and the footwear, 
which naturally conclude their utility after their relevant life phase. 
Third, products remaining across generations, such as inherited 
jewelry, traditional crafts, and family photo albums, which carry both 
physical durability and cultural significance through family lineages. 
Type of birth, emerged from our analysis of how products initially 
manifest, encompasses two distinct approaches: mass production 
and adoption, seen in products like the mass‐produced toy car and 
the standard cleaning tool, and personalized creation with DNA 
Integration, exemplified by our workshop’s concept of biomorphic 
footwear that incorporates users’ unique biometric data.
Death model is the next dimension revealing various patterns 
in both causes and forms. This dimension was derived not only 
from the cases of the workshop concepts but also from the group 
discussion. Natural causes were evident in bio-integrated products 
like conceptual bio-clocks and biomorphic footwear, which showed 
organic aging patterns such as material degradation and color 
changes. Three types of artificial causes also emerged. The first 
type, which we termed product “suicide,” was observed in smart 
devices designed with programmed obsolescence, where the 
product autonomously terminates its functions. Accidental death 
emerged as the second type, particularly evident in temporary-use 
electronics such as disposable smart patches that are designed 
with predetermined lifespans. The third type, which we categorized 
as “homicide,” was observed in cases such as smartphones that are 
intentionally disabled by their owners - through remote data deletion 
and permanent function lockdown - after being lost. The form of 
death manifested in three distinct patterns: physical death, as seen in traditional diaries where covers gradually degrade over time; digital 
death, exemplified by smart mirrors experiencing complete operating 
system failures; and combined death, observed in bio-clocks where 
both physical and digital functions simultaneously cease to exist.
The afterlife state dimension revealed various post-functional states. 
Complete annihilation was observed in biodegradable cleaning tools 
that fully decompose after their functional life ends. We identified 
temporary retention in cases such as biomorphic footwear that 
gradually decomposes while maintaining partial form. Software 
preservation emerged as another state, exemplified by smart diaries 
where the digital content remains archived even after the physical 
device deteriorates. Hardware revival represented a unique state, 
as seen in vintage violin bodies that continue their lifecycle through 
restoration with new strings while maintaining their original form.
DESIGN PROCESS AND RATIONALE  
Phase 1: Defining LSP Using the Property Dimension
The combination of specific types within the property dimensions 
generates numerous design concepts. The Life-Synchronized Product 
is a type of product derived from this process. The following explains 
which specific property types were selected from each dimension to 
solidify the LSP concept.
For the type of birth dimension, we selected personalized DNA birth 
at the time of adoption. Similar to how DNA determines unique 
characteristics in living organisms, we considered that incorporating 
users’ biometric information into the product’s foundational design 
could establish a bond that transcends conventional customization. 
Lifetime synchronization was adopted for the synchronization type. 
We anticipated that a product sharing its lifetime with the user, 
evolving and growing in tandem with their lifecycle, would present a 
LSP specific perspective on domestic technology. For the death and afterlife dimensions, we opted for complete death and disappearance. 
This decision was driven because we considered that it presents an 
alternative perspective to the perpetual existence commonly pursued 
by modern technology. By incorporating finitude into the product, 
it would prompt users to contemplate the fundamental values and 
meaning of life. We recognized that artificial life extension through 
component replacement or data transfer would parallel existing 
concepts like repair, recycling, and reuse. Thus, we regarded this 
choice was more suitable for an alternative proposal.

component replacement or data transfer would parallel existing 
concepts like repair, recycling, and reuse. Thus, we regarded this 
choice was more suitable for an alternative proposal.
Phase 2: Evolution of Hardware Design and Interface 
Concepts
After defining the properties for LSPs, we explored various 
product categories to determine which would be most suitable for 
implementing these conceptual properties. Our design thinking 
began with the metaphor of an LSP as a life companion - like a pet 
or an adopted child. As the idea evolved, we envisioned the LSP 
as akin to a life partner in a monogamous relationship: a singular, 
irreplaceable presence that grows old with the user, enduring life’s 
journey together until death. We extended this metaphor to imagine 
the product as a living being - one that is born, lives, and eventually 
dies. While the LSP was intended to embody the attributes of a living 
entity, it was designed to retain the form and function of a domestic 
appliance. This led us to frame the product’s components as organs, 
and its production, use, and disposal phases as birth, life, and death, 
respectively.
Among the fundamental human needs of food, clothing, and shelter, 
we selected food as our focus area and specifically chose an oven 
from the food-related product category. This choice was informed 
by multiple factors. Kitchen appliances enable frequent and natural 
interactions in daily life. An oven’s versatility spans both everyday 
cooking and special occasions, positioning it as a potential mediator 
of significant family events. Contemporary smart oven technology 
can be extended to provide personalized services based on individual 
dietary patterns and health conditions. The device can deliver value 
across the user’s entire lifespan, from preparing baby food to 
accommodating elderly nutrition needs. The following section 
annotates the process of conceptualizing and developing LO as an 
exemplar of LSP , detailing how these dimensional properties were 
integrated into its design.Figure 2. Property dimensions of life-associated objects (left) and example workshop objects mapped to these dimensions(right).  
Dotted lines indicate the combinations of properties that define LSPs.

Hardware Design Process
After selecting an oven as our product category, we envisioned its 
components functioning as sensory organs and effector organ 
of a living entity. Our exploration focused on how different parts 
of the oven could correspond to organs that perceive and respond 
to environmental conditions and user interactions. We integrated 
various sensory and responsive elements: a handle serving as both 
controller and kinetic response mechanism, internal lighting for 
emotional expression, and a projection display system visualizing the 
product’s cognitive processes. These components were designed to 
blend with the oven’s primary functions (Figure3, top). 
Two elements were selected as main interface parts: the handle and 
the upper display. The handle was designed as both a controller and 
the product’s antenna, expressing lifelike behaviors through physical 
feedback such as welcoming movements when users approach or 
self-initiated rotations during operation. The upper display serves 
as a portal for visualizing the product’s memories, displaying and 
exploring data collected through internal/external cameras and 
microphones. While we initially considered incorporating digital turntable functionality considered incorporating digital turntable 
functionality for emotional engagement, we ultimately focused on the 
interface to visualize lifetime interaction.
We also considered the product’s physical aging characteristics 
through two approaches: natural surface evolution based on usage 
patterns and periodic surface renewal. We explored how frequently 
used areas develop natural wear patterns and how environmental 
factors create unique patina through spots and textures. The final 
design allows the product’s exterior to evolve based on user habits 
and environmental conditions.
Evolution of Interface Concepts
We explored metaphorical approaches to express the shared 
lifecycle between product and user. Initially, we conceptualized LO 
as a hybrid oven-audio device, investigating how musical elements 
could represent lifecycle progression. This exploration included 
representing product-user interactions as individual musical notes 
that would accumulate to create a unique life melody. We considered 
how various events could be expressed through different timbres, gradually building into a complete symphony that represents a 
completed life (Figure 3, bottom).
During our exploration of various concepts, we came up with the 
Thread-of-Life metaphor, to represent lifetime and decided to develop 
this direction further as an interface medium. In Asian cultures, thread 
often symbolizes life’s journey - for example, in Korean first-birthday 
traditions, choosing a spool of thread signifies longevity. Inspired by 
this, we visualized the Thread-of-Life (ToL) as a design resource. We 
envisioned life’s daily and yearly repetitions as a spiral thread pattern, 
with memory beads forming at significant events. We believed the 
beads’ sizes and spacing could convey the density and frequency 
of experiences, while the thread and bead formation could naturally 
express the interactions between LO and its user.
In determining the visualization approach for the interface, we 
considered how to express the past, the present and the future and 
also keep reminding the finitude of time. We decided that future 
time should not be explicitly displayed and could vary depending 
on present circumstances, reflecting the uncertain nature of life’s 
duration. Thus, we chose the idea of representing potential futures as 
blurred or indistinct images.

sketches, and digital prototypes showing the development of the interface concept (bottom).
307
LO: LIFE-SYNCRONIZED OVEN 
LO (Life-synchronized Oven) is a speculative smart oven designed as an example of an LSP, synchronizing 
its lifecycle with the user’s, accompanying them through both life and death(Figure 4). The name ‘LO’ 
encompasses several distinct meanings: meaning of ‘aging’ as in a Chinese character, Living Object, Life-
Sync Oven or Living Oven, where ‘Living’ signifies the product’s possession of lifelike attributes. In the 
following sections, we elaborate the four key features.
Design Features  
Lifelike Expression
LO interacts with users and expresses thoughts and emotions through various sensory organs, utilizing 
all five senses to respond in a more emotive manner. To understand user context, LO integrates not only 
immediate sensory inputs like visual and auditory data but also temporal and cultural information from 
the surrounding environment. It interacts based on users’ medical and health data through the connected 
software service, utilizing diverse feedback mechanisms including physical movement, light, sound, scent, 
and text to convey not just information but the product’s ‘consciousness’ and ‘emotions’.
The primary sensory organs consist of four main components. The knob’s subtle vibrations and rotational 
pattern changes communicate LO’s basic emotional states such as animal’s antenna. When users 
approach, the dial rotates in a lively manner to express welcome. During cooking, it provides a warning 
by rapidly rotating when temperatures become excessive. When unused for extended periods, the knob moves slowly to express a sleep-like state. The lighting system visualizes emotional intensity and types 
through color and brightness, with different base emotions corresponding to different lighting patterns. In a 
peaceful state, it emits a soft, warm yellow light, while attention-requiring situations trigger sudden changes 
in saturated red. When trying new recipes, it flashes blue light to indicate curiosity.
LO also communicates through voice and sound, modulating tone, inflection, speed, and volume to convey 
various emotions. Its tone adjusts based on the user: calm and detailed for beginners, and professional and 
concise for experienced users. In emergencies, it communicates with clear and firm inflection. Additionally, 
LO’s ‘internal monologue’ and ‘thoughts’ are visually projected on the lower front surface, appearing only 
when LO intends to express thoughts. These thoughts and consciousness are expressed either poetically 
or in a conversational tone, serving as a medium for expressing the product’s stream of consciousness. 
For instance, it may express casual observations like “Baking with the sunset view through the window” or 
emotional reflections such as “From our first spring meeting, this is now our third winter together.”
The system can also display text that triggers long-term memory-based reminiscence, such as “Last year 
around this time, you made your first bread. I’m touched to see you now working with natural starters.” It 
provides messages of encouragement like “You were so disappointed when you first failed with this recipe. 
Now it’s become the family’s favorite dish,” journey reminders such as “We’ve made 450 meals together 
over these 3 years. Every moment has been special,” and nostalgic reflections like “I remember when your 
child first made a cake. I’m proud to see them doing it independently now.”Figure 4. System architecture of LO, a life-synchronized product that integrates hardware and software to express emotional, temporal, and relational states across a user’s lifetime.
308
Thread of Life(ToL) Interface
LO visualizes experiences and daily lives through an interface called the ‘Thread of Life’ (ToL). The ToL 
interface employs a spiral-based visualization technique that represents life’s trajectory and events as a 
thread pattern. The distribution of spirals and memory beads enables users to intuitively visualize both past 
life transitions and anticipated future events at a glance. The temporal dimension is represented through 
the spiral’s rotation, where one complete revolution corresponds to a single day, effectively expressing 
both the continuity and cyclical nature of time. The spiral can represent either a week, a year or a lifetime, 
depending on the mode adjustment. With this visualization, the center represents the present, with the 
left side depicting the past and the right side showing the future. Future projections are rendered as semi-
transparent spirals, with transparency and blurriness gradually increasing toward the distant future to 
represent increasing uncertainty in predictions. These personalized predictions are expected to be enabled 
by integrating data science and generative AI technologies(Figure 5).
User experiences and memories shared with LO are represented as memory beads within the spiral. The 
distribution and density of these beads reflect how users spend their time, with past spiral containing beads 
that serve as means for reminiscence, while future spiral displaying predictable events. The bead density indicates the frequency of interactions with LO, while bead size represents the volume of accumulated 
data. Environmental context is reflected through bead coloring, with a dynamic colscheme that includes 
time-of-day transitions from morning yellow to evening purple, temperature and humidity represented 
through color warmth, and ambient sound levels expressed through color saturation.
Navigation of the ToL interface is facilitated through the knobs positioned on either side of the LO’s handle. 
This intuitive control mechanism allows users to explore the temporal spiral naturally, enabling seamless 
navigation between past memories and future projections. The ToL interface transcends simple historical 
record-keeping by incorporating predictive capabilities based on users’ past and present circumstances. 
For instance, LO can detect lifestyle patterns of single-person households to predict significant life events 
such as marriage or childbirth, suggest adjustments to cooking capacity and recommend personalized 
cooking methods based on anticipated health changes, and propose culinary experiences and events to 
enhance present moments in preparation for future changes. The system can visualize evolving family 
dynamics, such as the gradually diminishing time spent preparing dinner with children as they grow, and 
highlight the cyclical nature of time through the periodic inscription of seasonal cooking memories within 
the thread pattern.Figure 5. Visualization of LO’s temporal memory interface, which allows users to navigate past, present, and speculative future memories through a spiral-based timeline and tactile dial interaction.
309
Adaptive Growth
LO exhibits both physical and intellectual growth that aligns with the user’s life cycle, distinguishing itself 
from conventional product aging or wear through its organic evolution in response to user changes (Figure 
6). This adaptive capability is predicated on advanced biomaterials and software technologies that enable 
responsiveness to user development. The physical growth of LO manifests in two primary dimensions. 
The first dimension involves the natural transformation of its biodegradable exterior which evolves into 
unique patterns based on the user’s expected lifespan, usage patterns, and environmental conditions. This 
evolution results in natural tactile variations around frequently used functions and areas, while environmental 
factors such as temperature and humidity contribute to the formation of distinctive patinas and textures. 
The second dimension encompasses adaptive changes in its physical interface, including automatic text 
size adjustments based on the user’s age and physical characteristics, optimization of button sensitivity, 
enhanced voice guidance as needed, and physical form adaptations to accommodate changes in the user’s 
physicality. 
LO’s intellectual growth is integrated with the user’s medical and lifestyle data, demonstrating sophisticated 
awareness and adaptation capabilities. For example, the system detects changes in family composition 
and adapts its interface accordingly, such as enhancing safety features when children begin participating 
in cooking and naturally modulating oven door opening speed and resistance. Furthermore, LO proactively responds to lifestyle transitions, exemplified by its ability to strengthen morning baking modes upon 
detecting post-retirement lifestyle patterns. The cognitive evolution of LO parallels the user’s skill 
development in several ways. As users demonstrate increased proficiency in basic functions, the system 
activates advanced baking modes and provides more granular efficiency options as energy usage patterns 
stabilize. Conversely, less-used functions transition into standby mode for energy efficiency, though they 
remain readily accessible through brief tutorials when needed. In its later life stages, LO exhibits signs of 
cognitive aging, manifesting subtle changes reminiscent of an aging companion, such as gentle display 
flickering or slightly delayed touch responses.
Simultaneous Cessation
LO’s end-of-life process is fundamentally synchronized with the user’s passing, triggered through integration 
with medical information systems. This cessation occurs in physical and digital dimensions. The physical 
dissolution involves decomposition processes across different material layers, including surface, internal, 
and deep structures, mirroring biological decomposition processes similar to organic matter returning to 
the soil. This process mirrors ancient burial practices, particularly those of Ancient Egyptian Tombs, where 
the product undergoes a dissolution .process (through cremation, burial, or decay) synchronized with its 
user’s end-of-life practices. The software dissolution encompasses the erasure of accumulated memories 
and information, incorporating a brief sharing period with others who shared the user’s lifetime before 
complete dissolution.Figure 6. Adaptive growth features that reflect LO’s physical and intellectual development in alignment with the user’s lifecycle and the end-of-life process

Speculative Scenario on LO’s Birth-Life-Death
Figure 7 illustrates how LO, the user and service provider interplay throughout the user’s lifetime and what 
activity flows occur during major events. The example scenario is described as follows.
Birth: A specialized coordinator guides users through synchronization and support services. The Birthing 
Kit includes DNA collection materials and consent forms. DNA information determines LO’s physical and 
digital characteristics based on life expectancy and biological rhythms. Birth occurs at a Birth Center, where 
DNA information determines hardware and software specifications. Hardware includes 3D printing filament 
calibrated to life expectancy, while software implements lifecycle prediction and biodata-responsive 
interfaces. LO then moves home for initial synchronization. Birth center specialists oversee setup as LO 
activates multi-sensory organs through self-learning. The provider verifies adaptation and configures 
DNA-based growth patterns. The Thread of Life interface begins recording events during the four-week 
synchronization.
Life: LO begins passively, developing multi-sensory capabilities by learning user patterns through door 
usage, voice, and cooking sensors. It responds through movement, LED colors, and vibrations, with 
expert monitoring. In adolescence, LO initiates interactions while learning daily patterns. User interaction 
creates physical changes in its biodegradable exterior, forming tree-ring patterns in touched areas. 
Emotional recognition enables contextual conversations and mood-based adjustments. The Thread 
of Life gains colored beads marking milestones and interactions - yellow for morning meals, purple for night conversations. In adulthood and elderly phases, LO adapts to user’s physical changes: larger text for 
vision, adjusted mechanisms for mobility, and optimized sounds for hearing. It ages through decreased 
sensitivity and wear, but regular maintenance ensures synchronization, supported by consent-based health 
data sharing. During its elderly phase, LO provides care while aging, simplifies interfaces, and maintains 
connections through memory features.
Death:  LO’s death aligns with the user’s final moments, monitoring end-of-life indicators through usage 
patterns and medical data. It tracks meal patterns, medication changes, and family visits while working 
with medical professionals. LO curate’s family memories, preserving recipes and special occasions. After 
the user’s passing, LO performs a farewell ceremony before moving to decomposition. Families can access 
stored information through the provider’s platform during dissolution. All data permanently erases upon 
completion, with provider confirmation to family.
LO Website
We developed a service website for LO demonstrating how Life-Synchronized Products (LSPs) receive 
support throughout their Birth, Life, and Death phases (Figure 8). The platform provides phase-specific 
services: Birth services for creation and deployment, Life services for maintenance during development, 
and Death services for aging and end-of-life processes. Like human medical care, LSPs require lifecycle-
based services. This shifts from traditional mass-production models toward treating products as 
living entities. Such a service ecoswwystem requires sustainable providers like government bodies or 
authorized institutions for long-term engagement.Figure 7. Interaction and activity flow among LO, the user, and the service provider throughout the user’s lifetime.

Birth:  When LO is created, it is synchronized with Peter. It extracts 
data necessary to predict life span from a DNA sample taken from 
Peter. This data reflects Peter’s predicted lifecycle and is used in 
biodegradable filament processing and 3D printing. The LO created 
DESIGN FICTION VIDEO
We created a design fiction video that condenses the entire scenario described above. This video briefly 
visualizes the journey of the LO oven, from its birth to death, in a narrative format. It depicts the LO oven 
as a unique companion that lives alongside the user throughout their lifetime and dies with them. The 
video is designed to help viewers imagine what it would feel like for an oven to synchronize with their Life: Initially inexperienced, LO gradually becomes adept at 
assisting Peter. LO understands Peter’s life patterns through 
various sensory organs and recognizes life changes. LO records

personal traits, LO could reflect and enhance the user’s identity. P4  
described it as “a unique and irreplaceable entity, almost like a 
lineage,” and P8 added that LO’s evolving CMF (Color, Material, Finish) 
over time could serve as a tangible marker of the user’s individuality.
Reflecting Life’s Finitude by Life Interface and Aging 
Features
The ‘Threads of Life’ interface was identified as a tool that could 
help users rediscover temporal meaning in the present by recalling 
significant past experiences and envisioning the future. P3 elaborated: 
“It will help people recognize the importance of precious moments 
spent with family in their lives. This goes beyond simple memory 
reproduction, acting as a tool for revaluating one’s current self and 
life values.” Similarly, P6 explained that users would “revisit past 
moments, recall their emotions and meanings, and reconsider how 
those experiences have influenced who they are today.” Regarding 
LO’s end-of-life ritual, P10 reflected: “It will prompt contemplation 
about what to prioritize before reaching one’s own end, reminding us 
of life’s finitude and encouraging the reestablishment of important 
values and goals in life.”
Experts indicated that LO’s aging representation could serve as a 
reflective element continuously reminding users of time’s finitude, 
flow, and impermanence. P5 connected the oven’s gradual wear 
to the concept of wabi-sabi [53], appreciating it as “a natural 
phenomenon embodying the flow of time.” P3 suggested that “the 
oven’s performance degradation could act as a mirror reflecting life’s 
passage and impermanence, beyond mere functional decline.”
The concept of declining performance presented a tension between 
reflection and utility. While the gradual performance decrease would 
prompt users to revaluate their current position and meaning in life, 
practical concerns emerged. P8 noted that “the oven’s declining 
performance could encourage reconsideration of everyday product 
performance and efficiency, teaching us to live more slowly.” However, 
participants also expressed concerns about decreased practical 
value. P7 mentioned that “some people might not want to face the 
aging of themselves or their surroundings daily,” while P9 pointed 
out that “slow responses could be inconvenient when efficiency is 
required.” Some suggested implementing switchable modes between 
reflection and efficiency.
Sustainable and Symbiotic Living with Non-human 
Objects
Experts highlighted LO’s potential to challenge conventional product 
replacement practicesreplacement practices and foster a culture of 
sustainable consumption. They suggested that LSP products like 
LO could encourage a shift from impulsive, disposable consumption 
patterns toward more deliberate choices, encouraging sustainable EXPERT INTERVIEW
Goal and Method
To gain external perspectives on how LO, as a Life-Synchronized 
Product (LSP), might function in daily life and influence user 
experiences, we conducted expert interviews. The study focused 
on examining its impact on fostering non-utilitarian values, as well 
as investigating how the relationship and interaction between users 
and LO could evolve over time. Additionally, we aimed to identify 
the technical, business, and socio-ethical challenges involved in 
implementing the LSP concept.
Ten design experts with practical experience were recruited for the 
study. These participants were selected for their creative thinking 
and empathetic abilities, which we believed would facilitate a deeper 
exploration of the LO prototype and its implications. They represented 
a broad range of fields - including UX design, sustainable product 
design, robotics, and AI interaction - and had hands-on experience 
across corporate, academic, and independent design sectors. While 
their years of experience varied, we prioritized selecting participants 
with at least a decade of relevant industry engagement, ensuring 
both depth and diversity in design expertise. The interview process 
consisted of four stages: (1) an introduction to the LSP concept and 
LO, (2) viewing a design fiction video, (3) interacting with the product’s 
service website, and (4) a semi-structured interview session. During 
the interviews, participants were encouraged to envision LO’s service 
experience from both user and service provider perspectives, offering 
insights into its expected values, benefits, challenges, and areas for 
improvement.
Each interview session lasted approximately 90 minutes and 
was audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. An inductive 
thematic analysis approach was employed, with three researchers 
independently coding the transcripts to derive initial themes. The 
themes identified by each researcher were subsequently compared 
and consolidated to construct a shared thematic framework.
Findings  
Fostering Profound Emotional Connections  
Participants described LO as more than a domestic appliance,  
instead envisioning it as an “intelligent being” or “personal avatar”  
that evolves through user interaction and embodies individual history. 
P1 remarked, “Starting with a birth certificate feels like welcoming a  
new life form,” while P9 noted that LO’s “intentional immaturity” during 
its initial learning phase fosters a bond as users provide feedback and 
guidance.
Experts highlighted LO’s uniqueness compared to mass-produced 
appliances, emphasizing its deeply personal and irreplaceaible nature. 
They observed that by incorporating elements like the user’s DNA and  living in symbiosis with non-human objects. P1 remarked, “LO, 
designed for lifetime use, has the potential to overcome periodic 
product replacement practices.” P4 emphasized its distinction from 
planned obsolescence products, noting, “LO prompts reflection on 
emotional durability and true longevity in product design.” Similarly, 
P10 observed, “LO could promote habits that prioritize quality and 
longevity over rapid consumption.”
DISCUSSION  
Advancing Research on Non-Utilitarian Values in HCI 
and Design
We introduced the concept of Life-Synchronized Products (LSPs) 
and its design exemplar, LO, which emphasizes non-utilitarian values 
in domestic technology. These values include existential reflection—
fostering an awareness of life’s finitude—and symbiotic living, 
emphasizing coexistence with non-human entities. The LSP concept 
builds on prior HCI paradigms such as calm technology [61]and 
ambient technology [26], while resonating with frameworks like slow 
technology [24, 42], positive design [14], and design for reflection and 
mental rest [51].
Expanding on these traditions, our research offers a distinct 
perspective by redefining the user-product relationship. LSPs position 
products as lifelong companions rather than replaceable tools, 
fundamentally altering how users interact with and perceive domestic 
technologies. LO exemplifies this shift by evolving alongside its 
user over a shared lifetime, fostering emotional connections and 
encouraging reflection. As LO accumulates usage and memories, it 
helps users confront life’s impermanence and prioritize meaningful 
values. Experts described LO as “transcending its conventional role 
and serving as an emotional supporter,” underscoring its potential to 
deepen engagements and enrich everyday experiences.
The LSP concept also aligns with Albert Borgmann’s philosophy of 
“focal practices” [3] and “engaging environments”[6], emphasizing 
domestic technologies that transcend mere functionality to enhance 
human lives with profound meaning and structure. By positioning 
LO as a companion that lives and dies with its user, LSPs challenge 
traditional human-centered design paradigms and introduce a post-
humanistic perspective. This reframing invites users to view everyday 
objects as entities with shared lifespans, fostering more reflective and 
deliberate engagements with technology. It also expands the evolving 
More-than-Human design paradigm [23] by emphasizing coexistence 
and mutual influence between humans and non-human entities, 
enriching domestic spaces with new layers of meaning.
Finally, LSPs contribute to sustainability by promoting longevity 
and reducing the frequency of product replacements. By fostering 
stronger connections between users and products, LSPs encourage 
313
more mindful consumption practices, aligning with ideals of durability 
and appreciation in design. This shift supports a culture of sustainable 
living, where objects are valued not only for their function but also 
for their enduring significance over time. Finally, LSPs contribute to 
sustainability by promoting longevity and reducing the frequency of 
product replacements. By fostering stronger connections between 
users and products, LSPs encourage more mindful consumption 
practices, aligning with ideals of durability and appreciation in design. 
This shift supports a culture of sustainable living, where objects 
are valued not only for their function but also for their enduring 
significance over time.
Further Considerations for Life-Synchronized Products
Several considerations arise when advancing the concept of Life-
Synchronized Products (LSPs) for broader adoption and practical 
refinement. Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that synchronizing 
the product with the user’s life may result in periods where the 
product functions less optimally. Using the ‘LO’ oven as an example, 
during its initial phase, ‘LO’ lacks awareness of user preferences 
and occasionally exhibits errors as it undergoes a learning 
process. Similarly, toward the end of the lifecycle, functionality of 
LO intentionally decline, manifesting as flickering displays, blurred 
projections, or minor mechanical misalignments. While these phases 
deepen the emotional connection between product and user, they 
also underscore the need for thoughtful design strategies to maintain 
practical utility alongside emotional engagement. Balancing between 
these dual objectives across lifecycle stages would be a critical area 
for further exploration.
Another critical consideration is that the applicability of the ‘Life- 
Synchronization’ concept may not be universal across all product 
categories. Products that address aspects deeply integrated into 
human daily life, such as food, clothing, and shelter, along with those 
facilitating long-term frequent usage and fostering relationship-
building, are particularly suitable for implementing the concept. On 
the other hand, products with inherently short lifespans, such as 
consumables, or those exceeding human lifespans, like homes, may 
not benefit from strict lifecycle alignment. Also, products dependent on 
evolving technologies may also pose unique challenges. For example, 
while artifacts like videotapes can physically endure overtime, their 
functionality becomes obsolete if the associated playback devices 
disappear. Further exploration is needed to determine how lifecycle 
synchronization could be applied to non- physical artifacts, multi-
generational products, or designs intended for specific life stages. 
Finally, the concept necessitates further exploration of alternative 
scenarios, particularly in relation to service integration. For instance, 
true lifecycle synchronization could begin at the user’s birth, creating products that evolve in parallel with the entirety of their lives. 
Similarly, end-of-life scenarios for products like LO could extend 
beyond complete disappearance, incorporating metaphors such as 
reincarnation. This might involve strategies like repurposing physical 
components through recycling digital memories as legacies for a 
meaningful continuation of the product. These approaches present 
new opportunities for research and development in life-synchronized 
products, while also raising critical questions about their practical 
implementation and long-term sustainability. Addressing these 
scenarios requires a careful balance between innovation and the 
technical, business, and socio-ethical considerations necessary to 
ensure the viability of LSPs across diverse contexts.
Technical, Business, and Socio-ethical Challenges on 
Life-Synchronized Products
We identified several prerequisite conditions that need to be 
addressed within current technical, business, socio-ethical contexts 
to realize the Life-Synchronized Products (LSP) concept. From a 
technical perspective, products, whether hardware or software, 
must ideally have an extended or adaptable lifespan equivalent to 
the human life. While current products often fall short of this ideal, 
increasing efforts within industries to extend durability highlight 
the feasibility of this requirement. For instance, Dyson’s Solar Cycle 
Morph lamp [17] is designed for over 60 years of use, exemplifying 
this trend. Similarly, mobile industry initiatives offering a minimum of 
8 years of software updates [28] further demonstrate the potential 
for extended product viability. However, as one participant noted 
during interviews, the challenge often lies not in a product’s ability 
to endure, but in users’ diminishing tolerance for older items. This 
observation underscores the importance of designing products that 
maintain both functional and emotional relevance over long periods, 
fostering a deeper connection that encourages continued use rather 
than premature replacement. Furthermore, technologies that enable 
a product’s material lifespan to adapt to changes in the user’s life 
should also be considered.
From a business perspective, another prerequisite involves developing 
methods to address the aging of products. Extensive modifications, 
such as component replacements, integrating new modules, or 
implementing software updates, can disrupt the preservation of a 
product’s identity continuity, invoking the Ship of Theseus paradox 
[62]. During expert interviews, participants emphasized the need for 
innovative repair concepts to ensure the   developing methods to 
addressdetermine how lifecycle synchronization could be applied 
to non- product remains a consistent companion throughout its 
lifecycle. One participant likened lifelong products to living organisms, 
stressing the importance of continuous care and maintenance. We propose shifting from a paradigm of breakdowns and replacements 
to one focused on care and healing for Life-Synchronized Products 
(LSPs). The traditional Japanese repair method of Kintsugi [63] 
which involves reassembling broken ceramics with gold to highlight 
their history, exemplifies this approach by nurturing and preserving 
the character of aging items. Additionally, design practices that 
incorporate accumulated traces from long-term use—such as patinas 
[34] or stains [8] —further reinforce the value of embracing a product’s 
history and character. These methods offer exemplary approaches 
for maintaining the value and identity of LSPs, ensuring their longevity 
and continued emotional resonance with users.
Lastly, the inclusion of DNA-based predictions in LSPs presents 
significant social and ethical challenges. DNA integration is a key 
element of this concept, symbolically linking the product to the 
user’s identity and underscoring a lifelong partnership. During the 
development of the LO product, various measures were introduced 
to address these concerns, including DNA usage agreement forms, 
life synchronization agreements, and product birth certificates. 
Additionally, design elements were incorporated to indirectly represent 
predicted lifespan cycles on displays, aiming to mitigate ethical 
concerns surrounding DNA usage. However, some participants 
raised apprehensions about DNA-based approaches, particularly 
regarding the perceived intrusion into individual destinies. These 
concerns reflect broader societal uncertainties about the implications 
of integrating personal genetic data into everyday technologies. We 
anticipate that increasing public familiarity with DNAbased services—
such as ancestry exploration [1] or assessments of individual 
susceptibility to vulnerable or potentially disease-causing conditions 
[12]—may gradually shift perceptions and foster greater acceptance.
  
CONCLUSION
This pictorial introduces the concept of Life-Synchronized Products 
(LSP) and demonstrates the potential of the ‘LO’ oven to provide non-
utilitarian values, such as existential and symbiotic reflection, through 
its design process and interview study. It offers a framework for 
rethinking how design can meaningfully engage with human values 
that are deeply significant, sparking discussions on the philosophical 
and practical implications of products that reflect life’s finitude while 
fostering strong emotional connections. We hope this contribution 
enriches the ongoing discourse on the role of constructive design 
research and more-than human HCI, inspiring researchers and 
practitioners in HCI and design to envision a future where products 
promote reflective, meaningful, and symbiotic ways of living.
