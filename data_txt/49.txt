Abstract
My research explores the intersection of diffraction theories, cre-
ativity, and artificial intelligence (AI) to develop new methodologies
for design research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). By em-
ploying Karen Barad’s theory of agential realism and the concept
of diffraction, I research how diffractive methodologies can offer
deeper insights into the complex relationships between humans
and AI. My aim is to contribute to the ongoing formalisation of
diffractive methodologies for design research, demonstrating their
potential to generate novel insights and design directions that may
be overlooked by traditional user-centered approaches.

1 BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION
The emergence of AI as a creative tool has fundamentally challenged
our understanding of creative practice. Traditional user-centered
approaches struggle to capture the complex dynamics when hu-
mans and AI collaborate creatively, as the boundaries between user
and tool become increasingly blurred. This dissertation investigates
these challenges through empirical studies of creative practitioners
working with AI technologies. Therefore, as AI systems become
increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, there is a growing need
to re-conceptualize our understanding of the relationship between
humans, technology, and the world around us. A handful of HCI
researchers have therefore began to engage with Entanglement

https://doi.org/10.1145/3706599.3721091HCI [18] (an adoption of entanglement theories: actor-network the-
ory, post-phenomenology, object-oriented ontology and agential
realism), with a view to to finding a pathway for the perceived short-
comings of HCI thinking [ 13,15,17,28,30,32,34,42,44,45,47,48].
Entanglement HCI [ 18] offers compelling frameworks for exploring
these complex interactions and their implications for AI research
and development. Of the entanglement theories offered by Frauen-
berger [18], Karen Barad’s theory of agential realism and object/
methodology of diffraction [5] appear to offer new pathways to-
wards understanding the world and our position within it. Agential
realism can be briefly summarized as a philosophical framework
that posits that entities do not have inherent boundaries or proper-
ties prior to their interactions. Instead, phenomena emerge through
what Barad terms intra-actions within an entangled state of reality
[5]. Diffraction is used as a conceptual and methodological tool to
explore the entangled nature of reality and knowledge production.
Barad [5]proposes diffraction as the method of "reading insights
through one another in attending to and responding to the details
and specificities of relations of difference and how they matter”.
Simply put, agential realism and diffraction suggest a more nuanced
understanding of my research focus: the human-AI interaction, one
that is mutually shaping. This mutual co-constitution is especially
evident in the context of creative interaction, which can often func-
tion as an ill-defined, iterative and exploratory process.
Agential realism provides valuable tools for understanding how
creative boundaries blur in human-AI collaboration. Rather than
treating AI as a simple tool, this framework helps us examine how
creative agency emerges through complex interactions between
human and machine. The diffractive methodology offers specific
analytical techniques for studying these interactions without reduc-
ing them to simple cause-effect relationships. Therefore, the work
of my PhD operates within this space: diffraction and creativity
with AI. I seek to cultivate connections between the spaces, finding
where knowledge can be exchanged, and how one might inform
a closer understanding of another. Understandably, there is uncer-
tainty about the potential of entanglement theories for HCI. One
of the significant criticisms is the challenge of converting entan-
glement theories to actionable design methods [ 42]. As such, the
research of my PhD operates with two goals. The first: cultivating
a better understanding of how AI impacts human creativity, under-
stood and analyzed through the lens of diffraction. Secondly, using
this knowledge to develop novel and actionable design methods
that look towards cultivating better tools, technologies and interac-
tions. The importance of this research is based on the premise that
user-centered design, whilst often useful and important, leaves a
number of questions unanswered. Frauenberger [18] suggests that
in leaving user-centered design behind, we can develop "agonistic,

participatory speculation methods to design meaningful relations",
rather than optimizing for user experiences. I am steered by the
questions asked within Entanglement HCI: what futures should we
designing for ourselves?
2 Objectives and Approach
In defining my objectives, I first discuss the key related work in
order to contextualize my questions.
2.1 Related Work
2.1.1 Creativity and AI. Creativity plays a crucial role in HCI [ 20],
influencing both the design process and the development of tools
(creativity support tools) to support creative work [ 19]. Advance-
ments in AI technologies have allowed for the development of new
human machine creative tasks. From an array of design tasks [ 23–
25,37,56,59] to considering AI as a design element [ 6,10,27,55,57],
to stage design [ 24], drawing [ 39,51,58], performance [ 49,53,54],
creative writing [ 16,21,36,46] and exhibition [ 35,38]. In particular,
AI for artistic applications has received much attention, such as
the political, cultural [ 40,60], aesthetic [ 22] and socio-technical
dimensions of AI in creative work [ 1,3,8,11,12,26,33,50,52].
Notably, AI for creative tasks because it often re-defines and re-
shapes the creative act, creating a new human-tool balance with
the creative process. However as I will discuss, current research is
limited in its ability to take stock of the ontological uncertainties
generated by AI, and as such tends to approach the research task
as a question of improving the user experience through iterative
refinement of algorithms, which is a huge simplification of the ways
in which humans live with technologies. Given this shortfall of the
user-centered research method, I turn to diffractive theories.
2.1.2 Diffractive Theories and Methods. Entanglement HCI [ 18]
discusses the ontological uncertainties generated by our changing
relationship with technologies. Frauenberger [18]advocates that
entanglement theories [ 43] such as feminism, post-humanism and
post-phenomenology should be applied to the study of technologies,
in order to understand how technologies become entangled with our
bodies and lives. Among other theories, Frauenberger [18] adopts
diffraction and agential realism [ 5]. Diffraction forms a central
theory around which my PhD is built. Diffraction involves reading
insights from different disciplines and approaches through one
another to produce new understandings by exploring differences
and interferences between perspectives. It moves beyond reflecting
or representing the world to actively intervening in it [ 5]. There
is an emergence of diffractive methodologies (DM) within HCI
[2,4,14,41,42,44,45,47], and often the utilization of DM facilitates
a deeper and difference-attentive understanding of technologies,
environments and people. Diffraction can also be investigated as an
object: Sanches et al . [48] present an insightful study of diffraction-
in-action , whilst others have applied diffractive studies to various
sub fields [29, 31, 32].
2.2 Questions and Goals
Given these two foci briefly explained in Section 2.1, I now turn to
the questions of my dissertation.
How do creative practitioners navigate and negotiate AI within
their work? I believe in the value of gathering new data, and a focusof my PhD research has been on cultivating connections with those
in creative industries in order to closely understand their interac-
tions with AI technologies, including building, breaking, changing
and resisting. My publications under review report the findings
of this data collection with diverse creatives. I have also worked
extensively with the Bridging Responsible AI Divides (BRAID)1
programme at the University of Edinburgh to map the global land-
scape of creative action with AI.
What methodological tools can help us understand and design for
human-AI creative collaboration? Simply collecting data does not
answer any questions. It is the process of the analysis in which new
ideas and results emerge. Therefore, the analysis process must be
led by a framework that is able to account for the complexities of
the data. In considering the countless ways creatives can use AI, it
is especially significant to not flatten the data. A diffractive analysis
or a diffractive reading should retain the dynamism and depth of
the data, accounting for differences and instability of boundaries.
How can diffractive research be used to preserve the complexity of
creativity, evaluate its forms and precipitate the development of better
interactions? The final question of my dissertation is to formalize
the diffractive lens I began to work on in Study 2. In doing so, I aim
to present a set of unique findings for creativity with AI. My work
with diffraction as a tool for analysis and reading will be formal-
ized into a diffractive methodology that challenges the notion of
user-centered design thinking.
2.3 Approach
The approach of this PhD is qualitative; I am focused on gather-
ing real world data of people using their technologies, and — in
partnership with these people — developing new methods for think-
ing about these interactions. Simply put, many involved artistic
interactions with AI are not viewed by the human as a simple user-
tool engagement, so why should the user-centered approach be
the most insightful way to investigate? I have chosen to engage
with diffraction for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is ill-defined as a
method and an object to investigate within HCI, not only by virtue
of its characteristics as a philosophical concept that it is difficult to
concretize into method, but in that the HCI field has seemed unwill-
ing to undertake the task of converting diffraction to an actionable
design method. In addition, it has been noted that in the process
of converting the concept of diffraction to a method we would
lose the flexibility that makes a diffractive view valuable. The HCI
community has much to do to unpack the meanings of diffraction
and entanglement, and their implications for design practices. My
approach seeks to not prematurely close around diffraction as the
only means to do future research in HCI, but rather to explore the
potential for diffractive research within HCI.
3 Contributions
3.1 On the Generative Text-to-Image Model
[7, 9]
During the first year of my PhD I focused on the complexities of
text-to-image models as tools in the public domain. Within this,
I looked at AI ethics. We conducted and presented a systematic
1https://braiduk.org
Diffraction, Creativity and AI: Towards New Methods for Design Research CHI EA ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan
examination of the anticipated and observed risks associated with
modern text-to-image generative models [ 9]. We built a taxonomy
of risk across six key stakeholder groups, identified 22 distinct risk
types from data bias to malicious use. The investigation we con-
ducted was intended to enhance the ongoing discourse on respon-
sible model development and deployment and has subsequently
achieved this goal, becoming the most cited investigation of the
risks of text-to-image models. In addition, by highlighting previ-
ously overlooked risks and gaps we aimed to shape research and
governance initiatives, guiding toward the responsible, secure, and
ethically conscious evolution of text-to-image models. During this
focus on text-to-image models, I conducted and published a study
focused on exploring the ability to empirically evaluate the pres-
ence of creativity in human interactions with generative models
[7]. In this work, I adopted evaluative frameworks from the field of
computational creativity and applied them to the interactions that
users can have with text-to-image models. We presented a number
of failings in generative models such as pastiche and imitation,
limited interaction and opaque process. Further, we showed the
connections that can be drawn between the work of computational
creativity and the mass use of deep generative models in a creative
context, as these new interactions offer ripe opportunity to under-
standing the processes and interactions of the user with “creative”
systems.
3.2 Study 1: Exploring the Practices of Creatives
Working with AI [8]
In the second year of my doctoral studies, I designed and con-
ducted a qualitative study that aimed to understand and explore the
real-world experiences of artists interacting with AI in their cre-
ative practices. ‘AI’ encompasses a countless range of technologies,
including text-to-image models, large language models, recommen-
dation systems and computer vision tools. We specifically recruited
artists who were both practicing professionally and who pursued
new ways to use AI tools. We discussed their identity as a cre-
ative, their creative history, their practice with AI and their visions
for the future. We uncovered a number of insightful findings that
contribute to the growing body of knowledge around how AI can
cultivate or dampen human creativity. We found a number of ten-
sions around our participants choice to use AI and their identity as
an AI practitioner, such as not being accepted by academic circles
for using AI. Furthermore, we looked closely at the mechanics of
their interactions, such as how they overcome TTI models not work-
ing as expected. We touched upon responsibility, and found that our
participants had developed complex opinions on ‘being responsible’
with AI. For example, some felt troubled by their choice to present
work made with AI, whilst others chose to allude to the presence of
AI in their work but not expose audience to the technology. Based
on our findings, and the feedback from presenting this work at CHI’
24, we developed Study 2, discussed in Section 3.3.
3.3 Study 2: Investigating Diffraction as a
Method for Design Research in HCI Using a
Study of Creative Interactions with AI
Expanding on the results of Study 1, we designed and conducted a
second phase. This phase was focused on expanding the creativeprofessions of our participants. We recruited a wide array of profes-
sions, including writers, performers, filmmakers, CEOs, musicians,
choreographers and dancers. Currently in review is the paper pre-
senting the results of this study. In this paper, we framed AI as a new
design material, using the affordances of the technology to seek
out the diffractive actions of our 20 participants. Particularly the
paper articulated findings of diffractive action, or the ways creative
practitioners shape projects diffractively. We answer the question:
how does diffraction play out in the process of creative interactions?
, articulating examples of how diffraction is practically enacted.
We explored how creative practitioners engage diffractively with
AI technologies, revealing insights that can inform future HCI re-
search and design practices. By examining the ways in which artists,
designers, and technologists interact with AI tools, we uncovered
several key themes that demonstrate the value of diffractive method-
ologies in HCI: adopting the machine vision, reshaping teaching and
learning processes, developing symbiotic relationships, intentional
resistance, exploring entanglements with the human body, rethink-
ing ethics and responsibility, and speculating on alternative futures
that redefine our relationship with AI. The study reveals that when
creative practitioners engage diffractively with AI, they embrace
complexity and contradiction rather than seeking simple solutions
or optimal outcomes. This approach surfaces alternative visions
of technologies and new design directions that can help address
the challenges of building for a world grappling with technolog-
ical anxieties and uncertainties about the future. These findings
highlight the potential of diffractive approaches to generate novel
insights and design directions that may be overlooked by traditional
reflexive methodologies. By attending to differences and exploring
the entanglements between humans, AI, and the broader socio-
technical context, diffractive practices can help HCI researchers
and designers move beyond notions of human-centered design
towards more nuanced, ethically-engaged, and transformative ap-
proaches. Our research also demonstrates the practical application
of diffraction as a methodological tool in HCI research. By actively
searching for diffractive actions in our participants’ practices, we
uncovered insights that might have been missed through more
traditional analytical approaches. This suggests that diffraction
can be a valuable complement to existing HCI research methods,
particularly when studying emerging technologies and complex
human-technology relationships. Reflecting on our methods, we
present four provocations that offer a starting point for integrating
diffractive thinking into HCI research and practice. As AI technolo-
gies continue to evolve and permeate various aspects of human life,
adopting diffractive methodologies may become increasingly cru-
cial for addressing the complex challenges and opportunities that
arise at the intersection of humans and intelligent systems. In rec-
ognizing the difficulty of translating theory to design methods and
practice, we did not offer a practical guide to investigating diffrac-
tion, but rather use our findings of AI in creativity to investigate the
realities of diffraction-in-action. We presented our findings across
seven themes: the view from the machine, teaching and learning,
symbiosis, breaking and resistance, the body, ethics, responsibility
and safety, and shaping the future of AI. We found that in searching
for the diffractive across these themes we uncovered valuable and
timely results that would have remained hidden had we framed
the human as simply ’user’. Following our results, we turned to a

discussion around the process of searching for the diffractive, and
identifying how these insights can assist us in developing diffractive
methodologies for HCI practitioners.
4 Expected Next Steps
The future of diffractive design in HCI holds significant potential
for advancing research methodologies and design practices. As
the field continues to grapple with complex socio-technical chal-
lenges, diffractive approaches offer a way to engage with multiple
perspectives and generate novel insights. By reading different anal-
yses, theories, or disciplines through one another, researchers can
uncover new patterns of difference and create more nuanced under-
standings of human-computer interactions. Therefore, by reading
the nuances of creativity with AI through the diffractive lens, we
can uncover new understandings of our relationships with tech-
nology. Subsequently, we can develop the diffractive methodology
through our closer understanding of the new ways we are creative
with AI (a complex and boundary challenging task).
Therefore, I plan to focus on the complexities and intricacies of
interacting creatively with AI by ’zooming in’ on the processes of a
handful of participants, and working with them over the course of
months. Specifically, I will focus on cultivating knowledge that takes
stock of the complexity of the creative process life cycle by working
closely with my participants to develop shared understandings and
analysis of their experiences.
I will contribute a detailed understanding of the human-AI cre-
ative dynamic, and present —from these findings— a development
and application of the diffractive methodology for HCI. Through
my focus on longitudinal case studies with creative practitioners, I
will document specific patterns of human-AI interaction and test
new diffractive analytical tools. This work will produce concrete
guidelines for designing and evaluating AI-enabled creative tools. I
will focus on maintaining and developing the theoretical founda-
tion while strengthening its connection to practical challenges and
outcomes in human-AI creative collaboration.
Concrete Methodological Steps.
•Document specific patterns of human-AI interaction through
detailed case studies of creative practitioners.
•Identify limitations of traditional methods in capturing these
interactions.

•Validate and test tools through longitudinal studies with
creative practitioners.
5 Dissertation Progress and Goals
I am a third year student at the University of Edinburgh in the
Design Informatics department, under the guidance of Professor
Ewa Luger and Doctor Caterina Moruzzi. I aim to present my disser-
tation by Spring 2027. At this stage I am working on planning and
developing my next study. I have begun to draft my thesis and have
my theoretical chapters sketched. I am also currently working as a
research assistant on the BRAID (Bridging Responsible AI Divides)
programme. The findings of Study 1, Study 2 and the defined next
steps — alongside my publications in AI ethics — will form the
body of my thesis. Post-graduation I wish to pursue an industryrole in research, focused on developing new ways to think about
building technologies for humans, and engaging with users in novel
ways. I would like to continue working in the field of creativity
technologies, such as building better tools for artists, musicians and
designers. Participating in the CHI ’25 Doctoral Consortium would
be immensely valuable to my progress as a PhD student, and will
meaningfully and practically assist me in shaping the direction of
my PhD by providing constructive conversations on how best to
define analytical tools for user research and how to shape my re-
sults into insightful and valuable publications. I have not previously
attended a Doctoral Consortium.
