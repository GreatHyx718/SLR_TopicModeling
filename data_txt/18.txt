Abstract
BillHart-Davidson’s“WritingwithRobots”[ 1]describescurrent
practicesofcreatingaugmentedresearchandwritingteamsthat
includerobots,algorithms,andothermachinepartnerswiththeir
human collaborators in designed space. In writing about emergent
workplace practices in high technology environments, we (authors
Michael and John) created a team of researchers, undergraduate
research interns, and robot assistants to create the forthcoming
book Artificial Infrastructures. In preparing the book, we used
Otter.ai [2] to transcribe interviews with three working profession-
als. Theseroughtranscriptions,producedbyalgorithmicassistants,
saved the team important resources, namely time, money, and
attention. TranscriptiontoolslikeOtter.aiquicklycreatetranslit-
eratedtexts—word-for-wordtranscriptsofspokenspeech. Inour
ensemble, transcriptions were then edited by undergraduate re-
searchers trained using Weiss’s Learning From Strangers [ 3] as
well as practice editing transcripts of other recordings of subject
matter experts. The core finding was that we, as researchers, were
abletoconcentrateonwritingouranalysesandorganizingbook
contentswhileourundergraduateteammembersremainedfocused
and more productive than previous teams working without ad-
vancedartificial intelligence(AI)tools. Overall,it wasa productive
and enjoyable research process with less frustration and tedious,
repetitious work, leading to more productive engagement. Our
initialfindingssuggestthataslongasresearchersretaintheirau-
tonomyinestablishingthestudyagenda,andSMEsareinformed
how AI tools are going to be used, research can be streamlined
and made more productive. We are realizing the Human-Centered
ArtificialIntelligence(HCAI)outlinedinShneiderman[ 4]inwhich
AI becomes a “superpower.” This experience report describes how
AI tools, such as Otter.ai’s transcription service, played a role in
our research ensemble for creating our forthcoming book Artificial
Infrastructures. Itoutlinestheresearchteamstructure,useofAI
tools, and the interplay between human and algorithmic agents to

Technological determinism tends to erase human agency while
ascribinghumancharacteristicstoartifacts: ananthropomorphic
transformation that erases human activity. But it’s important to
remember that the assemblage doesn’t work without its people
andweassertinsteadahuman-centereddescriptionofaresearch
network. Theresearchensembleisanassemblage,ofhumans,their
technological tools, and the impacts of place, of context, on the
functioning of the human and algorithmic nodes in the network.

interaction, embodying a complex interplay among elements of
human creativity, technological tools, and contextual influences.
This ensemble approach emphasizes the symbiotic relationship be-
tweenresearchersandtheirtools,advocatingforahuman-centered
framework that acknowledges the indispensable role of human
agencywithinthenetwork. Eachparticipant,whetherhumanor
algorithmic,contributesuniquelytotheresearchprocess,fostering
anenvironmentwhereinnovationthrives. Thiscollectiveendeavor
mitigates the risks of technological determinism and enhances the
richness and depth of scholarly inquiry. By integrating diverse
perspectives and capabilities, the research ensemble cultivates a
dynamic, adaptive, and resilient research ecosystem, capable of
evolvingalongsidetheverytechnologiesitscrutinizes. Thus,the
collaborative nature of a research ensemble ensures that human
insight remains at the forefront of technological advancement, fos-
tering a holistic understanding of networks containing human and
artificial nodes.
SomuchoftheconcernaroundAIisaboutthereplacementof
peoplewithautomatedmachines. Advocatingforaparticipatory
approachtointegratingrobotsintoindustrialprocess,TomSorell
argued in his Ethics and Information Technology article that “To
the extent that work contributes to human well-being (Arneson,
1990), the replacement of human beings in industrial processes
mayberecognisedbymanagersassomethingtobeavoided”[ 5].

edges that participatory approaches cannot always prevent worker
replacement. But changes in labor are not technologically deter-
mined. Used ethically, artificial agents become powerful assistants,
improving potential enjoyment. Artificially intelligent tools do not
displacehumansnormakeusunemployedontheirown. Unethical
labor practices do.
We do not aim to dismiss concerns regarding replacement of
human labor, but rather emphasize that it is not an inevitable or
“natural” outcome of automation. Administrators choose how they
involve employees in decision-making about AI’s impact. This
decision-making process is crucial for ensuring ethical integration
of AI technologies in the workplace, much like in the classroom.
Towards that end, Alan M. Knowles, in “Machine-in-the-loop writ-
ing,”discussestheconceptof load sharing theory [6]. Heexplains
that“thegoalofmostHRI[human-robotinteraction]researchinto
load sharing is to evaluate ‘the quality of human-robot interaction
and collaboration by examining the acceptability of the frameworkby human volunteers.”’ This framing emphasizes the impact on
humansratherthansolelyfocusingonproductivity. Extendingthis
further,Knowlesprovidesa frameworkforevaluatingthe ethical-
ity of “machine-in-the-loop” writing processes that students use

technology’shumanoriginsoccludesissuesofpower—makingit
difficulttounravelthedynamicsthatmakepeoplefeelsubjected

jugating other humans, it becomes easier to ascribe motives to
technological artifacts.
Our ensemble consists of researchers, one Senior, one Junior,
and six undergraduate students connected together in the desire to
create a book that records the experiences of three working pro-
fessionals, who have integrated AI technologies into their work to
differentdegreesoverlongspansoftime. Whattheseprofessionals
are concerned about is efficiency and time saving andcreating
opportunities for people to do fulfilling work that meets both eco-
nomic and workflow needs. In Knowles’ terminology, our aim was
tocreateamachine-in-the-loopensembleinordertoeffectivelyde-
scribe innovative workplaces. These tools enabled working groups
tomeettherequirementsoftheirorganizationsaswellasthepeople
working in these groups. Perhaps this has to do with our selection
of participants and their institutional roles, but none of them ex-
pressed concerns about what so many of our colleagues seem to
beworriedabout: replacementbytechnologyordisplacementby
work speedup.
Ourresearchensemblefunctionswellbecausewesharecommon
goals: making the wordsofexperienced professionalsaccessible,
durable, and meaningful to readers. We knew that three hour-long
interviews—three hours of transcripts—would be prohibitively ex-
pensive to have transcribed professionally. We understood from
thestartthatwewouldnotbeabletocreatehighqualitytranscripts
through a professional service. Otter.ai was one tool that could

scription process not only timely, but affordable. For a nominal
annualsubscription,wequicklyobtainedreasonablepreliminary

Important to the ensemble is the growing expertise of the six
undergraduateresearchinterns. Theirworkwasintrinsicinturning
literal transcriptions of speech into readable prose. One other
technology in our assemblage is Weiss’s 1995 book Learning From
Strangers [3]. Weiss’sisthebestsourceweknowforturningoral

as our guide for translating spoken word to formal written English,
a remediation of spoken speech into electronic text, and eventually
into formal printed text.

learning are limited by the vision of their human creators.
The tools and the connections that we make in building our
community of researchers becomes an important means of un-
derstanding the contributions of AI and how these programmed
agents support processes wealready know and use well. These as-
semblages, these groups, experience frustration and face problems
precisely at thosemoments wherecommunication vacillates. And
that communication can falter for any number of reasons.

None met our exact needs, but having multiple images allowed
her to focus on one or two stronger versions to further alter and

ofgenerativeAI:automaticallygeneratingvariedpossibilitiesfaster
than a human could render 10 distinct draft images. The AI did not

that output into deliverables as she decided was rhetorically ap-
propriate. Revising the AI-generated output into a usable form
required rhetorical knowledge and technical skills.
Teah did not merely proofread what the AI produced, she de-
veloped a visual language for representing the video content in
still images. Teah did not use the AI output as the printed image
here,butthe AI assistedher by generatingmultiple options. Teah

a role in prompting visual conversations and moving the project
forward. By using the AI tool, her team and ours generated nu-
merous different “good enough” images that served the purpose
oftheteam—inspiringfurthercommunicationanddesign. TheAI
tools did not replace the work of collaborative brainstorming or
development. Teah, as the human in this loop, “retain[ed] majority
of the rhetorical load,” and used AI tools as important assistants (p.
8) [6].
For the purpose of our assemblage, AI was an assistant in differ-
entforms. Itwasatimeandmoneysaver. Asmentioned,transcrip-
tionserviceswouldbeprohibitivelyexpensiveforthreeone-hour
interviews,rangingfrom$0.25to$0.90perminute. Ottercost$0.01
per minute, or $0.42 per hour(at the $8.33/month tier). Many tran-
scription services now use AI for initial transcriptions and add a
nominalfee(e.g.,$0.10perminute)forhumanproofreading,aneth-
icallyfraught exampleofhuman-in-the-loopwriting. Using Otter,

Though the economic affordances and impact of AI in this in-
stanceareremarkable,automatedtranscriptionhasconsiderable
limitations. Before integrating Otter into our research workflow,
we carefully considered our use cases. Each interview involved

cases already publically documented. We disclosed to participants
that interviews would be recorded and transcribed via Otter.ai and
that we would invite participant feedback on drafts. Ultimately,
Otter was viable because our interviews fit the use cases Otter’s
