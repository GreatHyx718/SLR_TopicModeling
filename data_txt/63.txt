ABSTRACT
This article examines sociotechnical imaginaries of generative artificial 
intelligence (GenAI) through the cultural lens of the film Barbie . The 
hyperreal setting of Barbieland serves as a prescient metaphor for edu -
cation in an increasingly synthetic world where the real and artificial 
converge. By analysing representations of artificiality and authenticity in 
the film, I argue that similar cultural assumptions and anxieties shape 
how GenAI is understood and implemented in education. The Barbie 
doll’s transformation from plastic figure to ‘real’ human raises questions 
about embodiment and identity that parallel debates about 
human-machine relationships in learning environments. Drawing on con -
cepts of simulacra and agential realism, I explore how narratives of 
technological empowerment influence educational practice. By juxtapos -
ing Western-centric views of Barbie  with Indigenous perspectives, par -
ticularly Ellen van Neerven’s ‘Water’ , the article critiques dominant cultural 
narratives about technology and intelligence. This comparison challenges 
commercial imaginaries of technological empowerment and suggests 
more diverse, culturally responsive approaches are needed to integrate 
GenAI in education.
Introduction
Talk about generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education tends to extremes. These AI 
systems, which algorithmically generate text, images, and code, have also generated much 
debate in education (Peters et  al., 2023 ; Sidorkin, 2024 ). GenAI is understood as a ‘seismic shift’ 
in technology and society, requiring an urgent response, as educational roles, responsibilities, 
and decision-making begin to quake (Bearman et  al., 2023 , p. 380). Technological advancement 
is expected to drive change in educational delivery, learning processes, and outcomes (Harasim, 
2000 ). But does GenAI possess such power? GenAI is neither artificial nor intelligent, rather 
these technologies mirror our sociotechnical and educational imaginaries. Analysis of such 
imaginaries in popular texts may help reveal unseen assumptions that shape educational practice 
(Dishon, 2024 ).

2 C. VALLIS
This article examines the implications of GenAI in education through deconstructing the hit 
film Barbie  (Gerwig, 2023 ). The hyperreal world of Barbieland serves as a prescient metaphor 
for the challenges provoked by GenAI in our increasingly synthetic world, where the real and 
artificial converge. The iconic Barbie doll epitomises artificiality through its manufactured nature 
as a copy of an idealised, contemporary woman: an object and a woman objectified. Materially 
and culturally, Barbie operates as a synthetic signifier of consumer culture, a pink marketing 
confection that is both contrived and unnatural, yet has real, natural consequences and inter -
actions in the world. I examine these conceptions of intentional fakeness and authenticity 
through Barbieland, where Barbie’s transformation from plastic doll to human brings into focus 
issues of embodiment and identity that parallel current debates around AI.
I argue that the film Barbie  and GenAI in education both play into myths and fears surrounding 
artificiality and intelligence, and these attitudes may be productively challenged by considering 
diverse social imaginaries. Echoing Dishon’s ( 2021 ) call to clarify authenticity in educational tech -
nologies, this analysis advocates rethinking GenAI through language and cultural texts. To this end, 
I contrast Barbieland with an Indigenous speculative futures perspective from Ellen van Neerven’s 
short story ‘Water’ (2014). Van Neerven, a Yugambeh writer from Queensland, Australia, presents 
fluid identities and alternative ways of knowing that question binary ideas of gender, embodiment, 
and the natural world, expanding our conceptual framework for AI in educational contexts.
Finally, I ask, do we choose Barbie as our posthuman prototype for education? What would 
education look like with more diverse social imaginaries and conceptual frameworks that con -
sider artificiality and intelligence as emerging phenomena rather than fixed entities? This framing 
asks educators and policymakers to advocate for values to shift to more relational, inclusive 
and culturally responsive approaches.
Theoretical framing
Sociotechnical imaginaries, collectively held visions of technology’s role in society (Jasanoff & 
Kim, 2009 ), underly the development and implementation of GenAI in education. These imag -
inaries influence policy decisions, educational practices, and public discourse about what AI can 
and should do in teaching and learning contexts (Rahm & Rahm‐Skågeby, 2023 ). By analysing 
cultural representations like the film Barbie , we can surface the assumptions and values embed -
ded in these imaginaries that inform educational approaches to GenAI.
To support this analysis, I draw on Barad’s ( 2003 ) concept of agential realism, which rejects 
fixed, inherent properties and instead understands phenomena as emerging through complex 
intra-actions. According to this theory, matter and meaning are mutually constituted through 
material-discursive practices. The material world and human culture or knowledge are deeply 
connected to the ways we discuss and understand them, and to how reality is produced and 
experienced. Our ideas and language have real-world effects, just as physical realities shape 
our thoughts and communications.
Barbie, both as film and material object, participates in material-discursive practices that 
produce meanings and implications not predetermined by their nature. While Barbie’s fantastic, 
plastic body may be perceived as ‘unnatural’ and artificial, it emerges from and contributes to 
complex societal, technological, and economic practices, and has real, natural consequences 
and interactions in the world. Similarly, GenAI outputs are inseparable from human inputs and 
interpretations; humans and technology affect one another, and are influenced by society’s 
views and expectations, as well as how we use and interact with these technologies in practice.
Barbieland
Artificiality is at the plastic heart of the Barbie  film (2023). Barbieland is a hyper-fabricated world 
that celebrates artificiality, revelling in Barbie’s status as both an icon and a commercial product. 
EDuCATIONAL  PHILOSOPHY  AND  THEORY 3
The film’s vibrant pink sets, stylised lighting, and camera lenses and movements create a visually 
artificial aesthetic, while the costumes evoke nostalgia by referencing decades of Barbie fashion. 
In an interview, Barbie  cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto describes how Director Greta Gershwig 
leaned into this intentional fakeness.
Greta called it ‘authentic artificiality. ’ We wanted this world to feel authentic even though it’s artificial… 
There’s a certain magic, and the only rule is it has to look lovely. Every day is perfect in Barbieland, until 
she starts getting existential. That’s when things change (Hazlewood, 2023 )
The hyperreal aesthetic parallels how educational AI is marketed: as a magical solution for 
effortless content creation. EdTech vendors amplify this narrative, but beneath the artifice GenAI 
remains fundamentally ‘algorithms created by humans over time, enacted in software and run -
ning on machines’ (Costello, 2024 , p. 427).
In Barbie , artifice and reality are contrasted through visual design. While Barbieland appears 
perfect and plastic-like, ‘real-world’ scenes have a more naturalistic cinematographic style 
(Hazlewood, 2023 ). This contrast visually expresses the film’s complex treatment of the interplay 
between fake and real, natural and artificial. The set design evolves with Barbie’s character arc, 
as her existential crisis disrupts Barbieland’s artificial perfection. Barbie’s angst is echoed in Billie 
Eilish’s soundtrack song ‘What Was I Made For?’ , which asks after the purpose and authenticity 
of an artificial world.
As Barbie begins to question everything, the audience sees Barbieland change; perception 
changes the world. This reflects the Baradian idea that perception actively co-constructs reality. 
Just as the reality of Barbieland shifts with Barbie’s increasing self-awareness, the integration 
of GenAI in education is not a fixed entity but one co-constructed through shifting perceptions 
and social imaginaries surrounding its potential. How we imagine GenAI’s potential in education 
influences how we develop and use it.
In a broad sense, Barbieland reflects contemporary Western societies that are becoming more 
artificial and less natural, less authentic, in material and abstract ways. Digital spaces, particularly 
social media, are filled with copies and facsimiles of people, emotions, and texts, complicating 
our understanding of what is real or authentic. The representations are often performances 
designed for public consumption, further distancing users from any inherent reality (Taylor, 
2022 ). Memes, in particular, express a sense of authenticity by deconstructing and remixing 
cultural truths or emotions that resonate with audiences that paradoxically become more distant 
with each iteration from the original source (Taylor, 2022 ).
The humour in Barbie  is self-referential and self-aware, drawing attention to the artificiality 
of Barbieland with a knowing wink to the audience. The film has been praised for its smart, 
satirical exploration of gender roles, and the contradictions of femininity, consumerism, and 
societal expectations. Some argue that Barbie has evolved from a symbol of restrictive gender 
norms to an icon of female empowerment (Maines, 2024 ). Yet this transformation also suggests 
that artificial constructs can be repackaged for different audiences without changing their 
fundamental commercial purpose, a pattern that echoes the marketing of educational technology 
(Selwyn, 2022 ).
Similarly, influencers engage followers and promote brands by being ‘authentic’ , appearing 
relatable and personal to their audiences, while balancing the expectations of brands as mar -
ketable commodities (Van Driel & Dumitrica, 2021 ). Culturally, it has become acceptable, even 
desirable, for social media influencers to position themselves as authentic and self-aware 
(Kádeková & Holienčinová, 2018 ). The ironic, self-aware tone of Barbie  resonates with younger, 
more media-savvy audiences by aligning itself with contemporary cultural issues of feminism, 
gender identity, and consumerism while promoting licenced products.
However, the film’s clever satire and social commentary licks rather than bites. In the film, 
real-world gender dynamics are playfully inverted—Barbieland is a female-dominated world 
where women reign and males (Kens) are ignored—how funny, what a fantasy! Mattel’s 
4 C. VALLIS
executives are lampooned as an elite corporate patriarchy, their power and privilege exaggerated 
in the sleek, minimalist offices of its towering headquarters. As a feminist critique, Barbie’s 
unrealistic, distorted world is used to mock and entertain. Despite these playful social critiques, 
the film upholds the patriarchal, capitalist values it pretends to subvert (Balsam, 2023 ).
Barbie’s artificial perfection and journey towards humanity parallel educational debates about 
AI authenticity. Just as Barbieland presents an idealised but problematic vision of empowerment 
through artificiality, AI promises of automated learning risk prioritising technological solutions 
over human relationships in education. The film’s commercial imperative similarly mirrors how 
educational technology is often led by market forces and ‘the visionary promises of inventors, 
investors, and industry figures’ , rather than pedagogical needs (Williamson et  al., 2024 , p. 427).
Barbie’s unnatural body
In the film Barbie , bodies are both cultural artefacts and sites of meaning. The Barbie dolls exist 
through artificially constructed, perfect bodies; their being is uncoupled from biological needs 
and nature. Their experience of the world is mediated through these manufactured forms, 
making them both consumers and products of artificial ideals.
The film’s inciting incident occurs when Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is disturbed by 
negative thoughts and her feet suddenly flatten. Barbie decides to travel to the ‘real world’ to 
find the disturbed child playing with her and fix this malfunction. Barbieland limits Barbie’s 
knowledge to believing girls love Barbie dolls because they embody unlimited potential and 
female empowerment.
Stereotypical Barbie leaves Barbieland and ventures into the Real World. There Barbie con -
fronts her creators at Mattel, the executives who literally and metaphorically want to put Barbie 
back in a box. After battling a ‘Kendom’ in a changed Barbieland, she chooses to embrace 
humanity with all its flaws. At the end of the film, Barbie transforms from man-made object to 
a ‘real’ woman via a visit to the gynaecologist. Gender is ascribed as a biological and material 
process, rather than a cultural one. This shift from plastic to flesh-and-blood destabilises ideas 
about embodiment and how physical form defines our experience of reality. Barbie’s under -
standing of reality is grounded in an imaginary plastic form that cannot have corporeal and 
sensory experiences like drinking and eating. Yet Barbie’s embodied nature does not prevent 
her from perceiving and interacting with our environment in human ways.
Toffoletti ( 2007 ) contends that Barbie’s plastic, artificial form transcends fixed categories of 
being, functioning as a posthuman figure that complicates our experience of reality and expands 
notions of identity. Barbie represents the merging of the nonhuman (plastic) with the biological 
(human form), becoming an object imbued with personality and agency and a symbol for fluid 
identity in our technologically immersed society (Toffoletti, 2007 ).
In the film, Barbie’s choice to become human suggests artificial beings may have genuine 
agency beyond their predetermined nature. Barbie can override her manufactured forms and 
predetermined role. When Barbie asks, ‘so being human is not something I need to ask for? Or 
even want? I can just… it’s something I discover I am?’ , she voices one of our greatest anxieties 
about GenAI.
The posthuman and imaginary emerge as clear distinctions collapse (Dishon, 2024 ). Human 
thought, interpretation and actions are profoundly influenced by our interactions with physical 
objects and their associated symbolic meanings (Lacković & Olteanu, 2021 ). In Barbie,  the tech -
nical, material, cultural, and commercial artificiality are entangled. Barbie may also be read as 
an ambiguous, posthuman imaginary and cultural text that anticipates challenges posed by 
GenAI as it increasingly blurs the lines between human and machine capabilities in education.
A fluid conception of identity and reality resonates with many Indigenous ontologies that 
view the world as interconnected, with permeable boundaries between human, non-human 
and more-than-human entities. unlike Western dichotomies of nature/culture or real/artificial, 
EDuCATIONAL  PHILOSOPHY  AND  THEORY 5
Indigenous ways of knowing often embrace multiplicity and recognise the agency of non-human 
actors in co-creating reality (Zembylas, 2023 ). This perspective offers a different view of Barbie’s 
cultural and material transformation, alongside the parallel tensions emerging in GenAI-enabled 
education. While the film resolves these tensions through individual empowerment and consumer 
choice, Indigenous ontologies suggest alternative approaches to human-technology relationships 
in learning environments.
Barbie as educational technology
The Barbie  imaginary promises a future of luxury and ease, powered by sheer aspiration, tech -
nology and consumerism. Likewise, AI is often framed as a progressive tool that can algorith -
mically transform education through adapting to students’ individual needs and preferences 
(Wong & Looi, 2024 ). This consumer-driven model of empowerment is embodied by Barbie  and 
in GenAI discourses of ‘personalisation’ from companies such as Khan Academy (Khan, 2023 ). 
Such imaginaries of empowerment provide superficial solutions and mask the deeper ethical, 
social, and human implications of these tools. They conflict with Indigenous epistemologies 
that value collective knowledge and relational ways of knowing (Martin, 2017 ).
The social, cultural, and economic influence of Mattel’s Barbie dolls that shape and are shaped 
by human activity are well documented (Pearson & Mullins, 1999 ; Toffoletti, 2007 ). Stereotypical 
Barbie embodies an idealised, artificial standard of eternal youth and flawless beauty that is 
unattainable, reflecting Western society’s ageist attitudes. In many Indigenous cultures, on the 
contrary, elders are highly respected for their knowledge and life experience, for their storytelling 
that imparts wisdom and encourages connections across generations and cultures (Souza, 2023 ). 
Mattel’s sociotechnological innovation is to respond to evolving social mores by relentlessly 
reconstructing and commodifying plastic identities, to maintain the consumption of Barbie 
goods and entertainment through contrived narratives.
The film refers to Mattel’s long tradition of marketing Barbie dolls as a tool for empowerment, 
encouraging girls to imagine themselves in any career, from astronauts to doctors. Barbieland 
is stocked with these dolls, such as President Barbie and Doctor Barbie. Much has been written 
about Barbie’s social function (Griggs et  al., 2023 ; Shah, 2020 ). In this sense, Barbie  continues 
a long tradition of promoting a material, educational technology that teaches girls about fem -
inine fashion and social roles. See Figure 1 .
While Barbie functions as a technology through its modelling of social roles, its evolution 
towards intelligence complicates our understanding of artificial agents in educational contexts. 
Technologies, much like Barbie, participate in the ongoing reconfiguration of the world. Just as 
Barad’s agential realism helps us understand Barbie as a phenomenon emerging through 
intra-actions, GenAI may be conceptualised as a fluid rather than fixed entity, shifting between 
algorithms, data, humans, and social contexts. Neither humans nor AI function as separate, 
autonomous entities.
Deconstructing Stereotypical Barbie’s journey in the film from artificial to ‘real’ , we find no 
fixed, inherent properties, not in the artificial perfection of Barbieland, nor in the supposedly 
‘real’ world. Barbie embodies Baudrillard’s concept of simulacra (1994), as a copy without an 
original. The film constructs multiple layers of simulation (dolls imitating humans, actors playing 
dolls, artificial worlds mimicking reality), just as GenAI systems generate synthetic content that 
simulates human-created work. This raises complex questions for education: How do we assess 
authenticity when GenAI can produce convincing ‘original’ essays? What constitutes genuine 
learning in an environment where both knowledge and its expression can be artificially 
generated?
When it comes to educational technology, discussions tend to polarise into deterministic 
binaries, seen either as inevitable disruptors or simplistic solutions (Matthews, 2021 ). This 
divide holds true for generative AI. For better or worse, GenAI is expected to transform 
6 C. VALLIS
educational dynamics by redistributing authority, traditionally held by teachers, across staff, 
students, systems, and corporate interests (Bearman et  al., 2023 ). Many researchers call for 
more critical perspectives of GenAI adoption (Baker & Hawn, 2022 ; Essien et  al., 2024 ; 
Markauskaite et  al., 2022 ; Peters et  al., 2023 ; Williamson et  al., 2024 ). Integrating algorithmic 
decision-making systems will require thoughtful evaluation of context, task criticality, and 
ethical dimensions to balance human and AI autonomy in teaching and learning (Bahroun 
et  al., 2023 ; Prinsloo et  al., 2023 ).
AI systems, intentionally or not, amplify biases by reflecting both statistical and societal 
biases from historical inequities and underrepresentation (Baker & Hawn, 2022 ). Barbie’s plastic 
vacuousness parallels AI, which, as a ‘stochastic parrot’ , mimics human behaviour, ‘that reinforces 
and propagates stereotypes and problematic associations’ (Bender et  al., 2021 , p. 617). In edu -
cational contexts, these biases manifest in unequal treatment of students from underrepresented 
backgrounds, reinforcing existing disparities in access and outcomes (Baker & Hawn, 2022 ).

(De)generative AI in education
Artificial constructs, whether material plastic or AI algorithms, are reconfiguring our notions of 
identity, authenticity, and education. The future of GenAI in education is unknown and unsettling 
(Vallis et al., 2024 ). Potentially, artificial intelligence could undermine the interpersonal and 
affective aspects of teacher-student relationships (Sidorkin, 2024 ). Synthetic media and 
AI-generated videos introduce new ethical challenges, including the potential misuse of deep -
fakes to simulate presence in online classes (Vallis et  al., 2024 ). These transformative and 
potentially deteriorative processes reflect what we might call (de)generative AI.
Artificial systems follow similar patterns of decay. Both Barbie and AI, despite their appear -
ance of permanence, are subject to natural processes of decay. The plastic PVC material of 
Barbie dolls degrades slowly: its complete decomposition takes centuries, as its polymer frag -
ments into microplastics that leach chemicals into ecosystems. Similarly, the data in AI systems 
may also rot and drift, producing lower quality outputs when training data becomes outdated, 
algorithms accumulate errors, or they fail to adapt to evolving real-world conditions (Baker & 
Hawn, 2022 ). Increasingly AI deepfakes are so convincing that it’s difficult to distinguish between 
human and code, between who is real and what is not. GenAI technology produces realities 
that feel authentic. Synthetic outputs seem so natural that ultimately, they may extend or 
transcend our conceptions of human intelligence and creativity (Peters et  al., 2023 ).
This entails acknowledging both the creative potential and deteriorative processes of tech -
nology; what we might call (de)generative AI. Over time, AI may degrade human capacities and 
social structures, rather than improve them. GenAI’s outputs, while impressive, can lack depth 
and human insight (Essien et  al., 2024 ). Overreliance on AI-generated ideas can limit students’ 
ability to think independently or develop more original solutions and reduce creativity (Habib 
et  al., 2024 ). It might also hinder critical thinking and dehumanise education if AI takes over 
tasks that require empathy, communication, and personal judgement, diminishing the importance 
of these human skills (Bahroun et  al., 2023 ). AI tools promise increased productivity and objec -
tivity in research, but also pose significant epistemic risks, such as creating the illusion of 
understanding more than they actually do (Messeri & Crockett, 2024 ).
The implications of artificial constructs extend beyond their immediate effects. Much like 
Barbie, it is what we imagine GenAI is used for that produces harm. Both function as technol -
ogies that reshape understanding and behaviour through their commercial deployment. Barbie 
is a homogenised commodity; educational policy and practice must resist similar commercial -
isation and corporatisation of teaching and learning through GenAI. The true Barbieland is a 
brand and product ecosystem that functions as a technology for generating profits and shaping 
consumer behaviour, beyond physical dolls. Barbie’s extensive transmedia franchise, spanning 
film, games, and apps, makes Barbie a commercial media platform (Bradshaw, 2023 ). This pattern 
of commodification is a growing risk with AI’s expanding role in educational spaces (Selwyn, 
2022 ; Williamson et  al., 2024 ).
In society and education, the artificial and natural are increasingly entwined. We have an 
ethical responsibility to stop perpetuating stereotypes and cultural norms through these tech -
nologies (Selwyn, 2022 ), whether they take the form of plastic dolls or algorithmic systems. 
Philosophical questioning and theory help us understand and shape the future of education, 
so that we may avert making irreversible mistakes in how AI is integrated into educational 
settings (Sidorkin, 2024 ).
Indigenous perspectives: Rethinking artificiality
The consumerist narratives and technological solutionism embedded in Barbieland reflect lim -
itations in how we imagine GenAI in education. Indigenous speculative fiction, particularly Ellen 
van Neerven’s story ‘Water’ (2014), presents a radical departure from these frameworks. Whereas 
8 C. VALLIS
Barbie’s journey reinforces individual transformation through commercial choices, Indigenous 
perspectives centre relational ways of understanding identity, embodiment, and the boundaries 
between natural and artificial. At a time when the idea of intelligence and knowledge is chang -
ing, education needs a more relational, ethically engaged pedagogy, that shifts away from the 
Western philosophical traditions of Barbie . Comparing ‘Water’ to the film Barbie , it is apparent 
that the film reinforces the status quo, despite its surface-level focus on feminism and inclusivity. 
We can extend this comparison to GenAI in education, and debates surrounding its role in 
addressing bias, representation, and social impact.
In ‘Water’ , van Neerven crafts characters who resist ontological boundaries, inviting readers 
to reconsider notions of being, identity, and reality from an Indigenous Australian perspective. 
The protagonist, Kaden, an Aboriginal woman, develops a romantic relationship with Larapinta, 
described as a ‘plant person’ . This interspecies relationship challenges Western ideas of ‘being’ 
and identity. Kaden asks herself, ‘What will I discover in this uncharted experience? How much 
of what it means to be human will sway in my mind like a ship?’ (p. 102) As Kaden embarks 
on an intimate relationship with a non-human, her preconceptions about gender and identity 
shift across biological horizons.
Van Neerven’s narrative technique supports this fluidity. The narrative is constrained to Kaden’s 
limited perspective, so that Larapinta’s inner thoughts and motivations are unknown to the 
reader. Larapinta’s ambiguous nature, neither fully human nor entirely plant, is further empha -
sised. By using poetic descriptions of the sexual intimacy between Kaden and Larapinta, the 
author creates space for readers to speculate and imagine, rather than constraining ideas with 
realistic, mimetic representations. The boundaries between human and non-human are permeable.
Moreover, ‘Water’ embodies an Indigenous understanding of the relationship between humans 
and their environment. Kaden’s relationship with Larapinta serves as a metaphor for her recon -
nection to her Aboriginal identity and heritage. As she becomes a cultural liaison for the plant 
people, Kaden also reconnects with her Aboriginal family and ancestral land. She reflects on her 
feelings towards her home island of Ki: ‘There is a groping sense of relief that I feel something: 
for this place, in this place. My country. My dad’s country’ (p. 107). u nlike Western cultures that 
often assume human superiority over nature, Van Neerven’s story reflects an Indigenous worldview 
where all aspects of existence are interconnected. This connection is deeply rooted in spiritual 
ties to the land. In Aboriginal cultures, ‘ancestral spirits inhabit the natural world and country is 
kin’ (White, 2019 , p. 99), entailing a sense of responsibility and reciprocity between humans and 
their environment. In stark contrast, Barbieland in the Barbie  film represents a Western worldview, 
where nature serves as a backdrop for human or artificial activities. Barbieland is an environment 
controlled by commerce rather than harmony and connection with the natural world.
Kaden’s uncle’s identification of the plant people as ‘our old people’ and ‘spirits’ (p. 113) empha -
sises a blurring between human, non-human, and spiritual in Indigenous ontologies. Linear Western 
conceptions of time and identity are disrupted by the plant people: ‘Something happened when 
the Dugai brought the sea up. They rose with it’ (p. 113), suggesting ancestral spirits can manifest 
in new forms and times. This non-linear view contrasts with Barbie’s monomythic hero’s journey 
(Campbell, 2008 ), a linear narrative structure rooted in Western storytelling. Barbie’s journey follows 
a clear path from her departure from Barbieland, and call to adventure and challenges in the 
Real World, to her eventual return and choice to embrace humanity. Barbie’s story progresses 
neatly from problem to resolution while Indigenous narratives, like those involving the plant 
people, emphasise cyclical time and the fluidity between past, present, and future.
‘Water’ concludes with Aboriginal and plant people uniting against the government and 
corporate entities that plan to evacuate and destroy Kaden’s ancestral home of Ki Island, among 
others, to build ‘Australia2’ , a super-island intended to host First Nations peoples. Van Neerven 
draws parallels with the British colonial project, which aimed to erase Indigenous cultures, 
treating them as ‘blank slates’ on which white practices and norms could be inscribed (Watego, 
2021 ). The story suggests that colonial narratives of progress can be challenged by reconnecting 
EDuCATIONAL  PHILOSOPHY  AND  THEORY 9
with the past. ‘Water’ becomes a radical act of hope, imagining a future where Indigenous ways 
of being and knowing are not just preserved but triumphant.
Diverse and alternative narratives, such as Indigenous futurism, help us rethink how identity 
and human-nonhuman relations are conceptualised, paving the way for a more ethical inte -
gration of GenAI in education. Intelligent teaching and learning need to honour Indigenous 
ways of knowing, living, and being, which have historically been marginalised or dismissed 
in academic institutions as incompatible with Western epistemology, ontology, and practices 
(Zembylas, 2023 ).
Acquiring knowledge is paramount in Western cultures and often separates the knower from 
what is known. However, from a Māori perspective, for example, knowledge flows from relationship 
and connection: it involves being with or being a part of things in a holistic way, and transcends 
observation or study (Peters et al, 2023 ). Indigenous ways of knowing value experiential, land-based, 
and intergenerational forms of knowledge that are often overlooked in Western education systems 
(Martin, 2017 ). While integrating AI into education entails balancing human and algorithmic agency, 
educators must also reconsider what constitutes knowledge and intelligence.
Rather than viewing reality as fixed, boundaries and properties are continually enacted, and 
emerging emergent through ongoing inter- and intra-actions (Barad, 2003 ). In Indigenous worl -
dviews, knowledge and ways of knowing are also more fluid, as they are based on relationality 
that connects people, Country, and entities in inseparable ways (Martin, 2017 ). These perspectives 
invite us to see Barbie, and by extension GenAI, not as discrete technologies but as phenomena. 
They come into being through complex material-discursive practices involving humans, 
non-humans, and sociocultural contexts which are neither natural nor artificial. Claims about 
authenticity affect how we view educational futures. Similarly, the uncritical acceptance of 
educational technologies as either inherently artificial or natural can shape educational visions 
in unintended and unwanted ways (Dishon, 2021 ).
When students use GenAI for writing assistance, for example, they engage in an intricate 
interplay between human creativity, algorithmic processes, and collective knowledge bases. The 
outputs are neither purely artificial nor authentically human; they emerge through this rela -
tionship. Educational policies and practices that simply allow or ban GenAI technologies are 
inadequate for entanglements of human and machine. Whether technologies are in organic, 
plastic or algorithmic forms, it is more helpful to consider them as dynamic entities and study 
the social, cultural, economic, and personal intra-actions they are part of.
Barbie and GenAI are perceived as tools that can help achieve technologically advanced 
futures but are there other imaginaries we aspire to in education? Barbie, as an evolving cultural 
symbol and sociotechnical imaginary, embodies shifting ideals of femininity, empowerment, and 
consumerism. Similarly, GenAI represents constructed visions of artificiality in human capacities 
like creativity and intelligence. Both Barbie and GenAI are shaped by societal aspirations and 
fears, influencing how we think about personalisation, empowerment, and the impact of tech -
nology on human life. Their evolving forms of artificiality also shape our views on education, 
creativity, and human development. By examining the dual narratives of empowerment and 
superficiality, Barbie’s influence highlights the need to critically evaluate how GenAI might shape 
education and culture beyond the limits of consumer-driven frameworks.
(Re)generative education
(Re)Generative Education is inspired by the fluid identities and plant people in Van Neerven’s 
‘Water’ . Fluid, adaptive approaches to learning help students understand diverse perspectives 
and enable creativity (Vallis et  al., 2025 ). Curriculum development should valorise diverse cultural 
perspectives on technology and intelligence in AI-related content and activities, as AI relies on 
pre-existing data (Habib et  al., 2024 ). Similarly, the development and implementation of AI 
educational technologies, as well as educational design, should reflect and respect diverse 
10 C. VALLIS
knowledge systems, moving beyond Western-centric models of intelligence and learning 
(Zembylas, 2023 ). Promoting GenAI as a neutral but transformative tool for learning often ignores 
the complex, everyday realities of educational institutions (Williamson et  al., 2024 ).
Equally important is creating time and space for teachers to build capability with AI tools, 
and to engage with and facilitate nuanced discussions about the nature of intelligence and 
creativity in an AI-enhanced world (Markauskaite et  al., 2022 ). Establishing ethical practices 
for AI use and insisting on human connection in teaching and learning practices, these are 
urgent issues in education (Vallis et  al., 2024 ). By adopting these practices, educational insti -
tutions can work towards a more responsible integration of AI, and a genuinely generative 
education.
Barbie and generative AI are neither artificial nor intelligent. Rather, they function as dynamic 
sociotechnical imaginaries that trouble the boundaries of education, creativity, and human 
development. By interrogating narratives of artificiality and authenticity, empowerment and 
superficiality, this article critically evaluates how AI might shape and be shaped by higher 
education. Juxtaposing Barbie  with Indigenous futurist perspectives draws attention to how 
cultural narratives mediate our technological horizons and are not predetermined. From this 
intersection, we glimpse the possibility of reimagining learning as a collaborative space where 
technology and human experience co-evolve, transcending reductive consumerist frameworks 
and opening pathways to other ways of knowing and being. From degenerative AI to indigenous 
futurisms, these insights could help make learning truly transformative.
