Abstract
1. We are destroying nature. 2. We do not know where to store our
radioactive waste. 3. In Chernobyl, wildlife seems to be thriving.
We have connected these three considerations in a Found Footage
design fiction exploring a near-future of an Austria that has put its
hope for an ecologically just and sustainable future into nuclear
waste disposal sites turned national parks protected by radiation.
This report displays artefacts from the ongoing project and dis-
cusses our design process, insights and learnings around Found
Footage as a design fiction method to pose critical questions about
the emotional factors of technology futures.

1 Introduction
“In the year 2030, overwhelmed by the exacerbating en-
ergy crisis propelled by escalating geopolitical conflicts
and environmental degradation, the Austrian govern-
ment approved a historical constitutional amendment:
not only was the paragraph prohibiting nuclear energy
removed entirely; nuclear energy was rendered a con-
stitutional right.
As demands for a solution to the ever-amassing piles
of nuclear waste grew louder, a lucrative planet-centric
opportunity presented itself...”
At first glance, nature conservation seems like an act of allyship
towards other species: against all forces of the powers that be, we
generously place parts of nature under protected status. However,
upon closer inspection, our shrewd humanity reveals itself in the

reasons behind, and the ways in which we enact these conservator-
ships: natural areas are often protected because they are of some
value to humans, and are often protected inconsistently. Those
parts deemed less important (i.e., with fewer human allies) are left
vulnerable, and even those under some form of natural protection
are still exposed to harms not included in whatever legal definition
they have been assigned (e.g. [ 27]), not to mention global harms
like climate change and pollution (e.g. [12]).
In an exploratory search for spaces where other species thrive
without human interference, we came across a documentary of
the Chernobyl exclusion zone [ 4] and were intrigued by the aspect
that this zone is protected for the unusual reason that it has been
rendered hazardous for humans to enter due to radioactive con-
tamination caused by the 1986 accident [ 6]. In a 2020 report on an
ongoing conservation project in the 30-km Exclusion Zone, the UN
paraphrase Sergiy Zibtsev, a forestry expert at the National Univer-
sity of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine, how “it’s ironic
that it’s taken a nuclear accident to create a richer forest ecosystem
in the CEZ” [ 45] and quote him elaborating “‘The pine plantations
that were there in 1986 have given way to more biodiverse primary
forests, which are more resilient to climate change and wildfires
and better able to sequester carbon[...]’ ” [ibid].
Every few years, there is some report or news story on how
well wildlife seems to be doing in the Exclusion Zone, usually
by highlighting the numbers of endangered species thriving and
the high levels of biodiversity, before pointing towards ongoing
research into understanding what impact radiation actually has in
the long term (e.g. [ 5,7,21,35]). There is a poetic cruelty to a place
where plants, animals and microorganisms are thriving because of
humans, by our own (un)doing, are excluded under threat of deadly
bodily harm. Is this what it takes to finally allow nature to be?
In the year 2020, the European Commission (EC) commenced a
second legal process against the Austrian government for their lack
of a national strategy for nuclear waste disposal [ 39]. While Austria
responded by establishing a national board tasked with tackling
this issue, an immediate solution was still to be anticipated at the
time of beginning this project.In this pictorial, we invite you to descend into the world of
Nuclear Protection National Parks , a Found Footage collection envi-
sioning an Austria where national environmental agencies work to-
gether with nuclear energy companies to create permanent wilder-
ness areas by storing radioactive waste in our most treasured na-
tional parks. Using fictional artefacts that invoke high degrees of
realism [ 15], we explore how this decision is received by the gen-
eral public a few years down the line, how the Nuclear Protection
National Parks affect Austrian rural life and the tourism industry,
and how different political factions weaponise this new system
of energy creation alongside nature conservation for their own
ideological agendas. We frame this material by a meta-discussion,
in which we reflect on the questions the footage so far evoked in
both design process and initial audience, and share our method-
ological insights around Found Footage as a method for exploring
techno-political futures.
2 Methodology
We developed the initial project idea as a project for the PhD
seminar Designing Differently, Imagining Collaboratively: The Need
for Socio-Technical Alternatives held by Ann Light at TU Wien in
spring 2023, focusing on planet-centricity as relationality with non-
humans [ 29,30] and touching on topics from more-than-human
design [ 13,17]. We took this direction of thought to the extreme by
not speaking for nature from a human-centric value system, instead
reversing current design priorities: our project explores the com-
plexities of designing a system that favours nature’s thriving at the
cost of human endangerment. Aiming to consider what this reversal
of values may mean in practice, yet problematise late-stage capital-
ism values as a whole, the question guiding our design stories is:
“What if the Austrian government seized the issue of nuclear
waste storage as an opportunity for nature conservation? ”
The following section delves into our process of exploring this
question through design fictional world-building by creating Found
Footage artefacts. We begin with discussing our choice of this design
fictional format by outlining the potential of Found Footage.

protective gear and visit the courses on safety in the radiation zones.
2.1 Fabulating Design Fiction through Found
Footage
Design fiction is particularly suitable for envisioning new techno-
futures, as situating technologies “within a narrative forces us to
grapple with questions of ethics, values, social perspectives, causal-
ity, politics, psychology, and emotions" [ 44, p. 22], and thus has
a long-established tradition in Human-Computer Interaction re-
search and practice, often applied in speculative design imaginaries
(with the terms ‘design fiction’ and ‘speculative design’ sometimes
used interchangeably) and participatory design [ 18]. Related work
in this vein encompasses, for instance, explorations of communal
energy futures via hybrid digital board game elements [ 23], specu-
lations on a more-than-human economic ecosystem around trash
[32], or speculative prototypes for navigating the Chernobyl Exclu-
sion Zone [ 42]. While many of these anticipatory and speculative
approaches centre concrete, closed scenarios in a possible future
(e.g., [ 11]), we follow the call to embrace counterfactuality and
open-endedness in our explorations [28].A frequent criticism of design fictions is that they are (especially
in the speculative tradition) often intellectualised and confined to
art galleries and academic discussions [ 18,46]. We therefore sought
to make our artefacts and world straightforward, pop cultural, lo-fi
and fun. With this aim, we decided to frame our project as a Found
Footage collection—inspired by/based on the Mystery Flesh Pit
National Park1online world building project [40].
Commonly associated with the horror film genre, Found Footage
is a storytelling technique via fictional artefacts that are presented
to the audience as non-fictional documentation material of events
with little to no mediation (usually without acknowledging the
fiction) [ 15]. Most commonly, the artefacts associated with Found
Footage are staged video and audio recordings2[15,31], but can

also encompass fake documents, newspaper clippings, advertis-
ing posters, chat logs, scribbled notes, etc.3. Presenting material
without much mediation by narrators beyond a loose connective
framing encourages audiences to closely examine artefacts to un-
cover the overarching story, and the world the story is set in, piece
by piece—a mode of engagement fostering problem-solving and crit-
ical thinking as audiences fill in the world and story blanks between
artefacts. Key to the allure of—and apprehension evoked by—Found
Footage storytelling is the use of aesthetics and media familiar to
the audience’s everyday life. This not only makes the fiction more
believable, but is also a particularly accessible and immersive for-
mat [ 22,31]. Besides being highly accessible through referencing
familiar formats, concepts and situations, such as brands, newspa-
pers, or everyday items, Found Footage lends itself to an ongoing,
open-ended project that includes different types of media, creating
opportunities for not only us as the original authors to add to it,
but potentially others to get involved and thus engage more deeply
with the topic. Despite all these qualities, Found Footage has not
gained wide foothold in HCI—so far, the only explicit instance of
working with the logics of Found Footage is presented by one of the
authors who appropriated Found Footage as an autoethnographic
method suited to autistic embodied ways of knowing [25].
We apply genre to Found Footage to further facilitate familiarity
and thus accessibility. Setting our design fiction in a late-stage capi-
talist logic (and staying true to the genre of origin), we played with
the genre of grimdark4, which features elements such as dystopia,
hyper-violence, the bleak and the macabre (sometimes fused with
3Examples aside from the aforementioned online Found Footage collection “Mystery
Flesh Pit National Park" [40] are books like “Found: An Anthology of Found Footage
Horror Stories" [14] or Podcasts like “The White Vault" [43].
4Shorthand for “grim darkness,” popularised as a genre term via the tagline of the
dystopian sci-fi tabletop miniature game Warhammer 40k: “In the grim darkness of
the far future, there is only war” [1].satire) that can be harnessed to reflect on the horrors, absurdi-
ties and moral ambiguities of the present real world [ 41]. Such a
gleefully spine-chilling setting can then be contrasted by keeping
the emotional tone of artefacts humorous and absurdist—rather
than horror and dread, artefacts can elicit feelings such as humility
and empathy by contrasting the dark with the light, and evoke “a
glimpse of more-than-human connection and a utopian yearning
for something beyond mere glimpses” [30].
2.2 Design Process, and a Note on AI
The project lore and artefacts took shape over several iterative
brainstorming, conceptualising and making sessions. In these, we
discussed a range of general themes we address with our design
fiction, and speculated on how specific areas of this fictional world,
such as social structures, culture, politics or the economy, would be
affected by this nature conservation step over the course of several
years, visually mind-mapping our reflections and collecting initial
artefact ideas in the process. Parallel to this, we explored the world
by creating sketch models of artefacts in different media, not all
of which made it into the Found Footage collection. Towards the
end, we decided on the visual and textual Found Footage material
suitable to represent the discussed themes and tensions. We then
created artefacts to resemble known media as closely as possible—
our references, and the materials used for this, are described more
closely in Appendix A. This process was new to us: while specu-
lative, critical and provocative designs commonly have believable
contents, but unrealistic presentations, found footage requires the
reverse: hyper-realistic presentation of content that may be quite
unbelievable. It was a different experience than we were used to in
our previous work with speculative and critical artefacts, as it felt
akin to uncovering artefacts from the past, rather than exploring
potential futures.

observation by the state security and intelligence service.
We further gained insights regarding the usage of AI to create
such artefacts, and would like to critically reflect on this here. For
the refined footage used in the final collection, we created most of
the visual material with the generative artificial intelligence (AI)
program Midjourney. Our main incentive to use AI was its acces-
sibility for quickly materializing design ideas. Even with limited
time and resources (read: money to buy expensive photography
equipment, design software, and just-the-right stock material), we
were able to generate a wide range of diverse and high-resolution
material. However, at the time of designing the Found Footage col-
lection, we were rather oblivious to the ethical issues of working
with AI. Since then, the ramifications of AI technologies on our
planet5[8], their dependence on human labour rooted in extrac-
tivist, neocolonialist logics of human exploitation [ 8,47], and the
nonconsensual use of artists’ work as training data [ 24,38] led us
to the decisions to abstain from using generative AI in our work
and future additions to this project.
We may have reduced or ceased our AI usage regardless: work-
ing with AI did not provide us as much creative freedom as we
initially anticipated due to the encoded bias and lack of diversity
in datasets used for algorithm training [ 8,38] not only limiting
design possibilities, but actually pushing it into a specific direction.
A design process often involves experimenting with material to
get inspired or find new, unexpected directions to pursue; thus, if
the material at one’s disposal is extremely good at, say, magazine
fashion and runway style images, then one is, of course, guided to
feature those more heavily. Despite the whole point of our project
5Ironic for a project that critically engages with, and deeply cares about, nature
conservation.being to deliberately play with the familiarity of specific aesthetics
(i.e., to some degree copying and regurgitating what exists and what
has been done time and again in the same fashion, pun intended),
AI generation quickly reached its limits when we had a very spe-
cific original idea. For instance, we found it impossible to generate
a stock photo style image of an office worker throwing a potted
plant out of the window and hence, had to resort to other means of
visualizing the scenario. When we imagine something original, the
realisation thereof is often restricted by what is actually embodied
in the training data.
3 Artefacts in the Found Footage Collection
We initially presented the Found Footage collection in a small-scale,
immersive exhibition within the context of our course. The narra-
tive framework of the exhibition was the criminal investigation of
a foiled ecocidal attack plot aimed at a Nuclear Protection National
Park, with an extremist beauty vlogger as core suspect. As part of
the imagined forensic team, the exhibition visitors were encouraged
to examine the artefacts, thus immersing themselves in the fictional
world. The exhibition was concluded by a discussion of the audi-
ence’s impressions, which we documented directly after presenting
from memory, resulting in the reflective questions presented in
section 4. To disseminate to audiences outside of academia, and
continue the project, we exhibit the living Found Footage collection
on Tumblr6.
Our artefacts scattered throughout this document invite you, the
reader, to witness scenes from the story of one possible version of a

planet-centric small European country, in the hope of connecting to
existing issues you may be aware of, and providing food for thought
about what kind of relationship to nature you (can) have, and want
to build in the future. If you have not been doing so already, we
suggest you take some time to look at them before reading
on.Below, we move on to the themes addressed by this project,
presented as questions we addressed explicitly with the project, as
well as additional, unexpected questions raised by audiences so far.
4 Questions provoked by this Project
4.1 Questions we asked in designing our
artefacts
4.1.1 At what pace do disasters have to unfold to be perceived as
such? There is something very strange to us about how we are
taken by the eruptive, the immediate and spectacular, yet manage
to ignore the slow violence and the slow disasters of the ongoing
climate crisis or environmental pollution that are no less irreversible
and detrimental to our planet [20, 26, 34].
4.1.2 Who decides what parts of nature need to be conserved/protected
and in whose interest(s)? More often than not, nature preservation
is motivated by values rooted in white colonial Western hegemony,
global power-relations and capitalism [16, 48].4.1.3 How do local decisions interplay with the globalized world?
Pollution and climate change do not halt at the boundaries of na-
tional reserves. Likewise, radical counteractive measures are not
contained within political borders of nation-states.
4.1.4 Can humans only change their behavior/advocate for some-
thing when there is a benefit/gain? And should humans change their
behaviour or advocate for something they have nothing to gain
from? What is our stance on profit-oriented tactics (e.g., greenwash-
ing) that have accidental positive effects? And (how) can humans
be kept from destroying/invading nature? Through advocacy for
ethical values. . . or through (the peril of) death?
4.1.5 When does something become a ‘new normal’? At what point
do we get used to, accept or acquiesce to a certain status quo? At
what point do we just stop caring or give up?
4.1.6 What do increasingly blurry boundaries between companies
and governments mean for decision-making over human and non-
human lives? Especially given that some governments eagerly jump
on corporate innovation bandwagons without properly evaluating
their long-term impacts on nature, humans, or society.

4.2 Questions our audience asked inspired by
our artefacts
4.2.1 What if ‘the Nazis’ win? Our audience initially strongly re-
jected our project, perceiving it as a proposal despite our presenting
it as fiction, and strongly opposing the scenario as such. Amused
reactions to the extremist viewpoints at play in our world quickly
gave way to discussions of real-life politics, and how such view-
points are being increasingly accepted. Extremist ideologies tend to
spur horrible dystopian fictions, but in reality, such ideologies can
become normalised and rationalised in the blink of an eye (indeed,
only last year, the Austrian right-wing party FPÖ won the elections
[36]).
4.2.2 Could this be real? Our audience was shocked at the fea-
sibility of the project, from the way our fictional company CEO,
newspapers and people online talked about it. They were reminded
of very real cases connected to climate change, exploitation of hu-
mans and non-humans, and other related issues, and how these
were talked about by different actors. Some were confronted by
populist slogans on stickers, and were unsure of to what extent to
sympathise with the different political players.
4.2.3 Are you serious? Given the context of planet-centric design,
our initial audience were unsure whether we were earnestly suggest-
ingNuclear Protection National Parks as a desirable future, resulting
in an earnest debate on whether this future would be an ethical
choice.
5 Discussion
Shatteringly, while we thought we were crudely exaggerating many
things, our audience’s comparing them with similar events or post-
ings in reality made us realise that what we considered exaggerated,
sensationalist, unrealistic pastiche turned out to often be more sub-
tle, boring and believable than actual similar real-life events and
communications. This was an important learning for us: while the
Found Footage genre needs to be based on familiar real-life contexts,
it requires enough modification to not be immediately recognised
as the mirror and provocation of reality it is: only by rendering
our design artefacts sufficiently detached from reality and thus less
loaded, they remain in the space of being playful, engaging and,ultimately, fun. If Found Footage becomes too real, it may no longer
serve as a useful basis for discussions by proxy.
Another unexpected insight came from our audience’s initial
strong negative emotional reaction: our scenario was immediately
challenged, our world written off as dystopian and our design as
not optimistic enough. Once we reassured our audience that the
project was not a proposal, but an exploration, upon engaging and
discussing in a more nuanced manner, some found several benefits
to the scenario. The initially extreme reaction surprised us and led
to the insight that, immersed in our fictional world and exploring
the ways in which different factions in this world perceived the
Nuclear Protection National Parks on the spectrum between “good”
and “bad”, we had somehow changed alignment over time towards
sympathising with those who accepted the Nuclear Protection Na-
tional Parks as something rather desirable and friendly on the whole,
possibly slightly brainwashing ourselves, as centering the thriving
of other species rather than only that of humans is a normative
value of our fictional world that we are able to share to some extent.
We like how this problematises more-than-human and planet-
centered design. Design explores the way in which values and
trends we adopt shape (more sustainable) futures; and which of
these futures would be desirable to humans (and to which humans
they would be desirable). What we, much like our audience, ini-
tially thought was sort of dystopian and “edgy”, in our process of
rationalising it from different points of views, in the end perceived
as normal. Among other interpretations, this design fiction could
also be read as a cautionary tale on techno-optimism, especially
compared to past and current real-life cases of technologies that
are enthusiastically adopted and have far-reaching consequences
to many aspects of our lives, as is the case most recently with AI
(exemplified among other things by our own uncritical embracing
of this technology as described in 2.2).
6 Conclusion
Making ethical debates about human relationships to nature under
global capitalism accessible to a wide audience was a main consid-
eration in choosing our medium and format. Quickly tying back
into real-world current debates, the project highlights the necessity
for constant democratic vigilance on a global scale, whatever pos-
sible future may come. Our initial audience confirmed to us how
CHI EA ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kay Kender and Ekat Osipova
presenting ideas in the frame of media and formats we know from
different parts of everyday life requires less interpretive effort to
imagine how a certain world or scenario would be communicated
or discussed if it were real [ 22]. By creating or perusing artefacts in
a world so close to our own, and recognising typical populist as well
as corporate talking points, our audience were quickly able to get
into nuanced discussions of a world they just heard of. Further, we
considered that Genre-ification played a significant role in rooting
these values emotionally: we often disregard the critical role emo-
tions play in shaping our political value systems, on which design
in particular has a strong influence as an evocative narrative force,
on an often subliminal level. The emotional atmosphere of a project
can leave a lasting impact that is norm-making and value-shaping,
especially if engagement should end with the first impression of
the overall vibe.
Our fiction is set in a world where the narrative that humans are,
by nature, the problem, has permeated the centre of society, ignor-
ing capitalism as the core of the problem and instead, in populist
fashion, blaming human nature in an essentialist, unforgiving way.
We aim to continue our Found Footage project, and are excited to
explore further the depths of the Nuclear Protection National Parks .
Coupling this anti-human belief system with the questions raised
by the audience, we want to examine next how the acceptance
of our fictional narrative could open new gateways into Nazism,
which is already strongly tied to closeness to nature [ 10]. Ecofascist
narratives quickly perpetuate racist, white supremacist and genoci-
dal aspirations [10], while ignoring capitalism as the problem and
derailing the fact that those disempowered by the same ideologies
(and capitalism at large), e.g., indigenous, racialised, poor or invol-
untarily displaced communities, are the ones disproportionately
burdened by environmental destruction [ 20,33,34,37]. If more-
than-human planet-centred design is not spearheaded by those
communities, who is to say what horrifying futures may result?
We believe this project exemplifies the untapped potential of
Found Footage as a method for HCI research. The relative closeness
to reality and systemic focus gives Found Footage unique advan-
tages to other speculative design formats, while maintainance of a
proxy distances participants from real-world experiences and exper-
tise just enough to facilitate accessible technopolitical debates. We
hope to see more projects like this in the future—we have also be-
gun applying Found Footage in our teaching, and would be excited
to see others do so as well.

Information
Below, we provide details on material and meaning of artefacts
where applicable. Unless stated otherwise, images were generated
with Midjourney AI. All texts were written by the authors without
application of AI. All artefacts were layouted by the authors in
Adobe InDesign, using fonts included in OS unless stated otherwise.
Figure 1: Cover image taken by first author, logo created by first
author using Adobe Illustrator. Font: Glitch Goblin (licence: free
for commercial use) by GGbot.
Figure 2: No notes.
Figure 3: Poster 1 (on the left) uses an altered version of the logo
ofNationalpark Hohe Tauern , a real-life national park in Austria.
Poster 2 (on the right) uses the real-life logo of the Austrian Min-
istry for Climate, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and
Technology (Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie,
Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie) .
Figure 6: For the newspaper artefacts, we reconstructed the
visual layout of The Guardian in InDesign, used the real-life logo
of the Guardian, and took inspiration from the overall writing style
common to this newspaper https://www.theguardian.com/europe.
The name Kardashian is a reference to the real-life Kardashian
family of celebrities (whose aesthetics Midjourney reproduces eerily
well), however, Kassandra is a fictinal character and not a real
person.
Figure 4: We chose a layout style and font similar to those
frequently seen in Vogue, vaguely replication their logo. Font: Star-
dom (licence: ITF Free Font License (FFL)) by Indian Type Foundry.
“Radek Philippe” is based on real-life luxury brand Patek Philippe,
recreating their style and citing their real-life tagline verbatim.
Figure 5 and 8: For the website screenshots, we used the online
fake Tweet generator Tweetgen [ 3] and a free to use Photoshop
template of a Youtube profile that, despite our best efforts, we
regrettably can not longer find. We used the online fake Tweet
generator Tweetgen. As we had stoppd using Midjourney at this
point, we sourced most our images from pexels, all free to use
without attribution [2].

•The slogan on the yellow sticker is based on the battlecry of
the Warhammer 40k faction the Dark Angels: “Repent! For
tomorrow you die!” [19, p. 22].
•The slogan on the white sticker is a satire on the racist, is-
lamophobic, and all-round unacceptable campaign slogan
“Daham statt Islam” (central-middle Bavarian vernacular
(Mundart), “Home instead of Islam”) used by the right-wing
populist party FPÖ (Freiheitliche Partei Österreichs, “Free-
dom Party of Austria”) in the 2006 Austrian legislative elec-
tion. According to [ 9], using the Mundart “Daham” for thestandard German “Zu Hause”/“Heimat” aims to contrast
an imaginary collective in opposition to a constructed ‘en-
emy’ (in this case, Islam). The fictional extremist move-
ment’s political slogan of our Found Footage project uses the
Mundart “Baam” for the standard German term “Baum” (tree)
to rhyme, continuing the approach of alienating ourselves
from and fearmongering about the other.
