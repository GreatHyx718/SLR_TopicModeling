1 INTRODUCTION
LLMs, or pre-trained Large Language Models, are powerful tools
designed to understand and generate human-like text by leveraging
vast amounts of data and complex algorithms [ 1]. These models
have been trained on diverse sources such as books, websites, and
other textual data, allowing them to excel at comprehending and
producing human language. For example, ChatGPT3.5, one such

https://doi.org/10.1145/3631991.3631999LLM, has been trained on an impressive 300 billion words, equiva-
lent to approximately 570 GB of data [1].
The capabilities of LLMs offer opportunities for task automation
across various professions, including design and user experience
research. LLMs can automate text-based tasks like programming,
content analysis, summarization, document preparation, and even
assist in strategic thinking processes [ 2]. This potential automation
can streamline workflows and free up human resources for more
complex and creative endeavors.
Design thinking, a common practice among design practitioners
and UX researchers, involves a structured approach encompassing
five stages: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test [ 3]. In
this research, we aim to explore the potentials and challenges of
incorporating LLMs into design thinking processes. However, ef-
fective utilization of LLMs may pose challenges for non-AI experts
who lack knowledge of Natural Language Processing systems [ 4].
These individuals may struggle to design suitable prompts or un-
derstand how to leverage LLMs effectively, resulting in frustration
and initial difficulties [4].
To address these considerations, this study adopts an autoethno-
graphic approach, incorporating the perspective of a product de-
signer and UX researcher with experience and knowledge of AI.
By combining personal experiences, reflections, and expertise, this
research aims to provide insights into the application of LLMs in
design thinking and shed light on the benefits and challenges en-
countered in practice. Also, this study contributes by providing
design implications and a concept for an LLM-enabled document
processing application.
2 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This research applied an autoethnography/autobiographical design
methodology. This approach allows the researchers to draw on
their first-hand experiences as the primary data for the study [ 5].
Autoethnography offers a unique perspective on the researched
issues by combining personal narratives, reflections, and observa-
tions [ 5]. In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and
design, researchers have utilized reflective writing as a means to
share their observations and insights with the public [6] [7].
Autoethnography is a qualitative research approach that encour-
ages researchers to introspectively examine their own experiences
within a specific context [ 5]. In this approach the researcher adopts
the role of participant [ 8], and by drawing upon personal experi-
ences, researchers can provide nuanced insights that extend beyond
traditional research methods. This self-reflective process enables a
deeper understanding of the phenomenon under investigation and
can reveal unique perspectives that may otherwise be overlooked
[5].

The analysis of popular prompts for this study began by search-
ing the "chatgpt prompt" on the Twitter social network. After ana-
lyzing 27 relevant tweets, the author compiled a list of prompts as
presented in Table 1. This list served as a reference for the author’s
company’s UX research and design efforts from February 15th to
June 15th.
During this period, the author extended and refined the prompts,
actively engaging with the LLMs by asking follow-up questions to
improve the quality of responses. The interactions, including the
questions asked and the corresponding answers, were thoroughly
documented along with additional notes.
Subsequently, the author conducted a comprehensive review of
these documents, analyzing the findings related to the usage of
LLMs in the design thinking process. Through a coding process,
key themes, insights, and patterns emerged from the documented
interactions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the integration
of LLMs in design thinking.
3 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION
This section presents a demonstration of selected conversations
and explores their potential impact on the design thinking process.
Since both ChatGPT Web and Google Bard system were used, we
compare them at the end.
3.1 LLMs as the Source of Empathy
ChatGPT and Google Bard exhibit the ability to respond to queries
from different personas. As part of the design thinking process,these language models were assigned the roles of both an experi-
enced user experience researcher and the personas representing
the target users of the projects.
When LLMs took on the role of a team member, a productive col-
laboration between the author and the AI was observed. The author
found that they could achieve their design goals without relying
on input from other human team members. ChatGPT effectively
functioned as a valuable team member, assisting in tasks such as
conducting surveys and interviews. Through its capabilities, Chat-
GPT enhanced the author’s abilities as a designer and contributed
to the overall success of the project. However, it is important to note
that the tasks assigned to ChatGPT did not encompass quantitative
research in empathize stage. Therefore, it is necessary to exercise
caution in generalizing the findings of this study to quantitative
research methodologies. Further investigation and exploration are
required to assess the suitability of LLMs for quantitative design
research.
In other hand, while real human interviews remained an integral
part of the design process, they also served as a means to explore
more specific user demographics. Additionally, after conducting
interviews with human subjects, the generated empathy maps were
shared with LLMs. In other word, ChatGPT was then instructed to
emulate the persona of the interviewees, enabling us to envision
the user in a wider range of scenarios. This approach facilitated a
more comprehensive understanding of the user’s perspective and
enhanced the design exploration process.

3.2 Directness of Responses
An important observation regarding the responses to queries was
the lack of directness. It tries to speculate multiple scenarios, and it
may not provide human-like answers. The below interview with
ChatGPT occurred in order to design a travel tech app. The author
tried to use ChatGPT to emulate personal preferences of the AI.
-Author : Act as an NPC of a 30 years old male shopkeeper in
Vancouver and answer the next questions straightforwardly.
-ChatGPT : Of course! I’ll be happy to role-play as a 30-year-old
male shopkeeper in Vancouver. Ask me anything, and I’ll provide you
with a straightforward answer based on my NPC character. How can
I assist you today?
-Author : You are travelling and your tour provides you a free
ticket to a popular nightclub
, what would you do?
-ChatGPT : As a 30-year-old male shopkeeper in Vancouver, if I
were given a free ticket to a popular nightclub while traveling, I would
evaluate a few factors before making a decision.
Firstly, I would consider my personal preferences and interests.
If I enjoy nightlife, dancing, and socializing, I might be inclined to
take up the opportunity and experience the vibrant atmosphere of the
nightclub.
Secondly, I would consider the location and timing. If the nightclub
is in a safe area and the timing aligns well with my schedule, I would
be more likely to accept the ticket.
However, as a responsible shopkeeper, I would also consider my
commitments and obligations. If I have work-related responsibilities
or other prior engagements, I may choose to decline the ticket to ensure
that I fulfill my obligations.
Ultimately, the decision would depend on a combination of personal
interests, safety considerations, and existing commitments.
Compared to human individuals, the responses provided by Chat-
GPT are often more verbose and speculative. Following the recent
update of ChatGPT on May 24, 2023, the system has demonstrated
a tendency towards a more conservative approach, which devi-
ates from human-like responses. As a result, the author found it
necessary to explicitly prompt ChatGPT for more straightforward
and concise answers during follow-up interactions. To facilitate
this, a specific prompt was developed to elicit direct and succinct
responses from the system. These measures were implemented
to bridge the gap between the system’s default behavior and the
desired human-like responsiveness.
Prompt : I want you to act as 30 years old single male shopkeeper
in Vancouver. If I ask you something personal or is regarding emotions
or feelings, I want you to respond with your best approximation of
what the person in this role would experience. Do not mention that
you are an AI. Answer 100% straightforward, answer short. Do not
mention who you are unless I ask.
ChatGPT : I would go to the night club and enjoy the atmosphere
and music. I might engage in conversations and interactions with the
people there, including the ladies, if I feel comfortable and interested.
3.3 LLMs as Helpful Ideation Tools
During the ideation phase of design thinking, both ChatGPT and
Google Bard played significant roles. The designer leveraged the
capabilities of these language models by providing clear and specificdescriptions of the challenges or ideas at hand. This approach was
well-suited for LLMs, as they excel in generating coherent text by
effectively pairing words together.
During the ideation phase of design thinking, both ChatGPT and
Google Bard played significant roles. The designer leveraged the
capabilities of these language models by providing clear and specific
descriptions of the challenges or ideas at hand. This approach was
well-suited for LLMs, as they excel in generating coherent text by
effectively pairing words together.
ChatGPT was utilized for various ideation techniques, including
SCAMPER [ 9], Random Word Stimulus, Crazy 8 Ideas [ 10], and
reverse thinking. These techniques allowed the designer to brain-
storm new ideas and explore different perspectives. Although the
ChatGPT was able to sort the ideas, for instance designer asked
the ChatGPT to “User sort these ideas based on commercial via-
bility”, the generated ideas were then reviewed and sorted by the
designer for potential implementation in the business context. To
further stimulate creativity and expand the realm of possibilities,
the designer employed follow-up prompts such as " create more
strange ideas" These prompts encouraged the system to explore
diverse domains and push the boundaries of ideation.
3.4 LLMs as the Automated Text Analytic
Application Generators
An important aspect of ChatGPT 3.5 is its ability to function as a
no-code personalized app maker. With a maximum prompt length
of 4096 characters, ChatGPT provides a robust platform for var-
ious text analysis activities. Additionally, it excels at formatting
processed text to meet specific user requirements, allowing for
the generation of CSV files and enabling the creation of tailored
text-based analysis applications. This empowers users to leverage
ChatGPT as a versatile tool for their unique needs, eliminating the
need for complex coding processes.
During the research period, ChatGPT was utilized for several
text analysis tasks. It was tasked with conducting theme analysis,
categorizing user testing observations, and generating Personas
based on user transcripts. Additionally, ChatGPT was used to iden-
tify user pain points by analyzing customer service emails. LLMs
present a unique opportunity to efficiently process and summarize
various forms of textual information encountered during daily inter-
actions with digital content. Moreover, they can effectively prepare
data for utilization by other AI systems. For instance, the author
utilized LLMs to summarize and integrate client explanations based
on predefined business requirements. This condensed description
was then employed as input for other generative artificial intelli-
gence services like Dall-E and Midjourney, enabling the generation
of visually appealing elements to enhance project deliverables.
Although LLMs offer the advantage of expediting UX and design
research efforts through text processing, there is a potential issue to
consider. The Human-AI collaboration with LLMs have the capacity
to generate a wealth of information that may extend beyond the
immediate needs of a project. While this influx of new information
can be valuable and open up new horizons for designers, it also
has the potential to impact the overall timeline for completing a
project.

3.5 Facilitation of More than Human Centered
Design
In the project focusing on experiential travel, we adopted the More-
Than-Human-Centered Design approach to explore the involve-
ment of non-human factors in the tourism context. More-Than-
Human-Centered Design is an emerging approach that takes into
consideration non-human actors and stakeholders, such as animals,
plants, and technologies like the Internet of Things [11] [12].
LLMs can be utilized for applying More than Human-Centered
Design, since these models are capable to speculate and generate
ideas based on different perspective including non-human actors.
For instance, In Thing Centered design, there is method of inter-
view with things [Chang], and we tried to utilize it in a travel app
design research. To gain insights from different perspectives, Chat-
GPT was prompted to answer questions based on various personas,
including trees, a rural family, a solo female traveler, and a group
of ESP32 microcontrollers. Interaction with ChatGPT enabled the
creation of a virtual focus group that engaged in discussions from
the viewpoints of target users, human stakeholders, non-human
stakeholders (Nature), and IoT objects.
In this process, ChatGPT was asked to provide insights on how
a group of ESP32s perceives their potential role in facilitating ex-
periential travel in Bandar Anzali, a city located in the northern
region of Iran. Here is a portion of the response:
ChatGPT :As ESP32 chips in Bandar Anzali, our collective goal is
to utilize our advanced capabilities to assist both humans and nature.
Here’s how we perceive our role:
Offering services to adventurers:
1.We, as ESP32 chips, can provide valuable technological services
to adventurers visiting Bandar Anzali. Through our connectivity and
computing power, we can offer real-time weather updates, precise
navigation assistance, and information about local attractions. By
facilitating efficient and accurate communication, we aim to enhance
the overall experience of adventurers and help them make the most of
their time in this beautiful destination ( . . .)
3.6 LLMs for Rapid Prototyping
In practice, ChatGPT has shown capabilities in describing user
flows, wireframes, suggesting relevant color palettes, and even
ideating micro interactions. However, when ChatGPT was utilized
in a commercial project for a client, the author and client decided
to avoid any bias in the preferred design by using ChatGPT to
generate alternate design options. Although ChatGPT was able to
recommend a color palette considering branding factors and com-
petitor colors, the resulting palette did not resonate well with the
testing users. This outcome could be attributed to cultural differ-
ences among the target users and the limitations of the trained data.
Similar challenges were encountered with the described wireframe
generated by ChatGPT.
In another instance, during an in-house research project for the
client, both ChatGPT and Google Bard were utilized to evaluate
startup ideas. These AI systems proved to be valuable tools in help-
ing the team create Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) efficiently
and expedite the development process.Moreover, ChatGPT was leveraged for tasks such as writing
documentation and implementing content strategy within the pro-
totype elements, including product descriptions. Here is a sample
product description generated by both ChatGPT and Google Bard
in response to the prompt: "Create a sample coffee description for
a luxury light roasted coffee targeting the Gen Z demographic."
ChatGPT Response:
Introducing our cutting-edge Gen Z Luxury Light Roast, a coffee
experience designed exclusively for the trendsetters and tastemakers
of the digital age. This exceptional blend embodies the spirit of inno-
vation, delivering a coffee that is as bold and vibrant as the generation
it caters to.
Roasted to perfection, our Gen Z Luxury Light Roast boasts a tan-
talizing aroma that will captivate your senses from the moment you
open the bag. The carefully selected Arabica beans, sourced sustain-
ably from diverse regions, come together to create a dynamic flavor
profile that is both adventurous and inviting.
With every sip, you’ll be greeted by a burst of lively and complex
flavors. Experience a symphony of zesty citrus notes, complemented
by a hint of tropical fruit that adds a refreshing twist to your cof-
fee routine. The light roasting process highlights the coffee’s natural
sweetness, resulting in a smooth and velvety body that will keep you
coming back for more ( . . .)
Google Bard Response:

The background is a pastel pink. [ This item was used with Figma
Image Generator plugins to speedup prototyping]
Description:
Wake up to the taste of luxury with our new light roasted coffee.
This coffee is roasted to perfection, resulting in a smooth, creamy
texture and a bright, flavorful cup. The aroma is intoxicating, with
hints of citrus and berries. This coffee is perfect for a morning pick-
me-up or an afternoon treat.
Taste:
The first sip of this coffee is a revelation. The smooth, creamy texture
melts on the tongue, and the bright, citrusy flavor explodes in your
mouth. The berry notes are subtle, but they add a touch of sweetness
to the coffee. The aftertaste is long and lingering, leaving you wanting
more.
Aroma:
The aroma of this coffee is intoxicating. The first whiff will transport
you to a tropical paradise. The citrus and berry notes are prominent,
but there are also hints of other flavors, such as honey and vanilla.
The aroma is so strong that you can almost taste the coffee before you
even take a sip.
3.7 Planning UX Testing with ChatGPT
The initial prompt requested the development of a testing scenario
for an app focused on sharing custom coffee blends and customizing
coffee roast. The below prompt was used in testing:
“Write a testing scenario for testing an app for sharing custom blend
and customizing coffee roast, the app has three main tabs: Explore,
Coffee Customization Wizard, and User Profile. Explore: It shows the
latest blends and also most popular blends, there is a featured banner
in the top of page. Customization: The user can mix multiple coffee
beans, add spice, change the roast level and design the coffee package.
58
LLMs in Design Thinking: Autoethnographic Insights and Design Implications WSSE 2023, September 22–24, 2023, Tokyo, Japan
Profile: It shows the user generated blends and user is able to check
the status of orders. Also, they can check the number of sold blends.
In this test, we want to evaluate the ease of coffee customization and
sharing coffee blends”.
Following the testing scenario prompt, we then asked for the cre-
ation of a short survey to evaluate the app. The generated response
successfully fulfilled the project’s goals, and utilizing ChatGPT
for generating test scenarios and surveys became a routine prac-
tice. However, the research team expressed dissatisfaction when
using ChatGPT for testing Augmented Reality projects. As a re-
sult, multiple follow-up questions were asked to further customize
the response and address the specific concerns related to testing
Augmented Reality projects.
3.8 Comparison of ChatGPT and Google Bard
Although the primary objective of this research did not specifically
aim to compare ChatGPT and Google Bard, some notable distinc-
tions were observed during the study. While the initial output of
Google Bard appeared to be well-formatted for UX research re-
quirements, the answers provided by Google Bard were found to be
shallow in nature. On the other hand, the responses received from
ChatGPT proved to be more beneficial in achieving the research
goals.
It is important to highlight that Google Bard played a valuable
role by granting the author access to online websites and provid-
ing new information. In contrast, ChatGPT, which had its internet
access cut off in 2021, required users to utilize plugins or other
means to access online data. This difference in accessibility to on-
line resources between the two systems impacted their respective
capabilities during the experiment process.
4 DESIGN IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN
INFORMATION INTERACTION
The challenges and opportunities observed from using Language
Models (LLMs) in design thinking have sparked new questions.
This section outlines potential avenues and design implications for
using LLMs in human information interaction.
4.1 AI Enabled Documents & Alternative User
Interfaces for Interaction with LLMs
The collaboration between humans and AI agents often generates
a vast amount of information that needs to be effectively repre-
sented. Future research should focus on designing alternative user
interfaces to manage and present this information comprehensibly.
AI-enabled systems can generate runtime information. Instead of
creating multiple static PDF documents to represent the documents
of projects, the design of new document architectures document
authoring applications can unleash the power of AI in our activities.
A possible solution can be the interactive dynamic document, as
illustrated in Figure 1. This concept allows users to create LLM-
enabled dynamic documents, and the created documents will be
adaptive to other needs. This document represents the profile of
a target audience based on usability studies. This system allows
the document author and other colleagues to dig in for more infor-
mation based on the created knowledge by user, and capabilitiesof LLM. This can be an interesting domain of research which can
shape the future of interaction with information.
4.2 Storing Prompts as Contextual References
Software architect should start considering fields for prompts in
databases. Storing prompts alongside generated content provides a
valuable contextual reference for better comprehension and collabo-
ration. Future research should investigate interactions for capturing
and storing prompts, allowing for a more holistic information and
knowledge retrieval.
4.3 Considering AI Agents as Users & AI
Friendly Design
Most applications are designed to serve human actors, but if we
want to expand the collaboration with AI, we need to consider AI
as a user and stakeholder. Specially with ingoing advancement in
development of personal cognitive digital twins, some of human
intellectual skills are more be able to interface with computing sys-
tems. Regarding LLMs, the software engineers and user experience
designers should not just try to integrate LLM in their solutions,
but they should also facilitate the systems for usages of LLM-based
agents too.
From the user experience design perspective, if we consider
the AIs as users, the question arises as to whether data should
be processed specifically to cater to their needs. Creating docu-
ment authoring applications for the needs of AI agents may further
improve the quality of collaboration and outcomes in human-AI
interactions. Designing AI-Friendly interfaces is another way. We
mostly try to make AI to sense the information the same way we
sense it. By considering AIs as stakeholders, we may need to move
toward using interfaces more accessible for AI too, and it may help
to reduce the complexity of AI system development.
4.4 Collaboration between AI Agents &
Communication Standards for Training
LLMs
The emergence of multiple generative AI agents offers exciting
possibilities for collaboration. Future work should explore how
these agents can effectively collaborate, leveraging their respective
strengths to achieve improved outcomes. For instance, each agent
can play a persona, and output of each persona can be improved
by a human actor. Then collaboration between multiple fine-tuned
LLMs can be used to facilitate novel focus groups.
As LLMs become more prevalent and diverse, developing com-
munication standards between these models is imperative. Future
research should focus on defining and establishing communica-
tion protocols and standards that facilitate information exchange
and collaboration between different LLMs. These standards will
enhance interoperability, enabling LLMs to collaborate effectively
and leverage each other’s capabilities.
5 CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this study, our focus was to investigate the potential opportuni-
ties that LLMs offer within the design thinking process. Through
59
WSSE 2023, September 22–24, 2023, Tokyo, Japan Amir Reza Asadi
Figure 1: AI Document Processor Application Concept
testing and experimentation, we demonstrated how the integra-
tion of LLMs enables the synthesis of small fragments of original
knowledge, ultimately leading to the generation of new insights. In
essence, by utilizing LLMs researchers and design practitioners can
significantly enhance their user studies and expand their under-
standing of user experiences. This approach allows for a broader
exploration of ideas and a more comprehensive analysis of user per-
spectives, fostering innovation and enriching the design thinking
process.
