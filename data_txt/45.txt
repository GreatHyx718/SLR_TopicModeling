Abstract 
Built environments increasingly incorporate new forms of intel-
ligence, creating opportunities for enhancing human interactive 
experiences with and within building spaces. This scoping review 
examines design interventions and discourses within the domain of 
“Smart Buildings”. The goal is to identify and characterise the type 
of human experiences that research in this domain aims to address. 
Using a hybrid deductive-inductive coding approach, we analysed 
192 papers related to human experiences and smart buildings from 
ACM Digital Library and Scopus published between 1996 and 2024. 
Our analysis revealed 11 distinct “targeted human experiences”, 
20 commonly used “design mechanisms” to achieve those design 
goals, as well as two typologies of “technological interventions”. 
Our findings create a foundation for understanding building design 
research and the range of human experience they entail.

The convergence of research and design endeavours in architec-
ture and interaction design (IxD) has brought forward new ways 
of thinking about the relationship between humans and the built 
environment. Historically, research in the domains of architecture 
and building performance engineering has focused on human expe-
riences through an objective lens [98], often using environmental 
sensing and metrics such as thermal comfort and indoor air quality 
to assess and improve building design [39]. In human-computer 
interaction (HCI), questions around architectural spaces began to 
emerge, notably in the foundational paper on places and spaces by 
Harrison and Dourish [78] in 1996, which explored how people 
interact with physical spaces through a digital lens [78]. Across 
various domains, researchers have since developed a deeper un-
derstanding of how technology shapes human experiences within 
built environments, moving beyond objective assessments of the 
environment to recognise individual differences and subjective ex-
periences. In recent years, researchers and designers have sought 
to re-imagine the role of interactive technologies embedded in our 
built environments [2, 173]. This has been complemented by new 
visions that interface HCI with the domains of architecture and 
urban design to delineate a new area of design research under the 
banner of human-building interaction (HBI) [3]. HBI delves into the 
relationships between digital technologies, physical spaces, and the 
human experiences they shape [3, 19], considering the subjectivity 
and individuality of human experiences. 
Furthermore, HBI acknowledges that technologies impact hu-
man experiences in smart building environments in various ways. 
Designers and developers who create and shape smart buildings in-
herently embed both explicit and implicit values, assumptions, and 
expectations from their respective disciplines into the experiences 
they envision or the technologies they create [173]. For example, 
they might focus primarily on enhancing human comfort (across its 
four classic dimensions: thermal, visual, acoustic, respiratory) [5], or 
on human agency and control [27]. They might promote supporting 
individual needs [17], or collaborative, community-centred interac-
tions [91]. They might frame the role of the built environment in 
people’s lives purely as functional spaces [177], or as immersive,

responsive environments that contribute to emotions [115], sustain-
ability [106], and social engagement [150]. Furthermore, with the 
rapid and pervasive deployment of interactive technology, smart 
building environments are increasing in complexity, and the factors 
involved in shaping human experiences are also increasingly mul-
tifaceted. By and large, smart building research consists of a rich 
but fragmented body of work encompassing diverse perspectives, 
methodologies, and disciplines. This highlights the necessity to 
conduct a comprehensive mapping of the literature in order to un-
derstand the full scope of what we design for when we design smart 
buildings. Our review studies human experiences in smart build-
ings through this central question: what do we envision and research 
when we design for human experiences in future smart buildings? 
The answers to this question not only shape how smart building 
experiences are created, but also how people interact with, value, 
and experience the spaces they inhabit. Smart buildings, in this 
perspective, are not just passive infrastructures; they are active 
“shapers” of individual, cultural, and societal attitudes toward the 
built environment. We seek to uncover these visions through a 
scoping review, addressing the following research questions: 
• RQ1. What are the different types of human experiences that 
research in the broad domain of smart buildings aims to 
improve or introduce? 
• RQ2. What are the design methods and approaches employed 
in smart building research to shape human experiences? 
• RQ3. What types of technological interventions are devel-
oped or conceptualised to enhance interactive experiences 
in smart buildings? 
To address these questions, we analysed 192 papers that con-
tribute to the research and design of human experiences in smart 
buildings, sourced from the ACM Digital Library and Scopus. Using 
a hybrid latent coding approach [30], our scoping review provides a 
comprehensive descriptive analysis of how smart building research 
has explored human experiences in relation to digital technology. 
Specifically, we offer: (a)a classification of 11 distinct human experi-
ences that smart building research aims to improve or introduce, (b) 
a classification of 20 commonly used design mechanisms employed to 
enhance or create these human experiences, and (c) a typology of the 
technological interventions used to impact these human experiences. 
Our contributions help in understanding and describing the 
current and future of smart building design research, while incorpo-
rating a broad, diverse range of human experience in these spaces. 
2 Background and Related Work 
In this section, we first clarify key terms used in our scoping review. 
We then review existing secondary research on human experiences 
in smart buildings, identifying gaps that motivate our research. 
2.1 Clarifying Relevant Terminology Pertaining 
to the Scoping Review 
Our scoping review is built around the terms discussed below: 
“Smart” Buildings: Previous works use terms like “smart build-
ings” and“intelligent buildings”, often interchangeably with the 
term “built environment” [32, 104]. Irrespective of the term used, 
the goal is to create a responsive environment where users interact 
with buildings through automated systems that optimise functions like lighting, heating, and ventilation, using data-driven approaches 
to adapt to occupants’ needs [147]. Smart buildings also emphasise 
human-centred design, aiming to create environments that foster 
occupants’ satisfaction or agency [120, 122]. In our review, we do 
not distinguish between these terms, collectively referring to them 
as “smart buildings” throughout the paper. 
“Interactions” (with)in Smart Buildings: We view interaction 
in smart buildings as a dynamic relationship in which humans 
and buildings influence and determine each other’s behaviour. We 
believe this relationship can encompass all forms of interaction 
described by Hornbæk and Oulasvirta [86]: the interaction between 
occupants and the embedded technologies within a building can be 
understood as a continuous dialogue, a transmission of information, 
as tool use, as an adaptation towards optimal behaviour, and a 
controlled move towards a target state, but also as embodiment and 
experience (and likely other concepts as well). Using “interaction” 
as another search keyword in our review, we do not discriminate 
against a specific understanding of interaction. With this view of 
interaction, in which “[u]sers, with their goals and pursuits, are 
the ultimate metric of interaction” [86], human experiences can 
similarly be viewed holistically. 
“Human Experiences” in Buildings: There are different con-
ceptualisations of experience, e.g. Wright et al. [176] ’s composi-
tional, sensual, emotional, and spatio-temporal “threads” or Wright 
and McCarthy [175] ’s lens of empathy. However, we do not em-
ploy a specific existing framework of user experience to constrain 
the type of human experiences that we extract from the litera-
ture. Instead, our review includes diverse and emergent aspects 
of human experiences in smart buildings, without imposing any 
predefined structure. We consider the experience of occupants in 
smart buildings as context-dependent, influenced by embodied cog-
nition, emotions, sensory inputs, and ongoing interactions with 
their environment. 
“Comfort”: In this paper, we frequently refer to “comfort” as 
a technical term that has been meticulously studied in architec-
ture and building performance engineering, and which comprises 
four dimensions: “thermal”, “visual”, “acoustic”, and “respiratory”. 
These dimensions have also emerged in HBI research. For example, 
thermal comfort has examined personalised heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems [41, 97], addressing social 
dynamics like shared control [114, 169] and the impact of data dis-
plays with environmental information [47]. Visual comfort studies 
have explored the importance of lighting design [21, 25, 182]. Re-
search on indoor air quality has focused on raising awareness [183] 
and encouraging behavioural changes, often using playful systems 
[72, 155], and acoustic comfort studies examined noise preferences 
and control mechanisms through surveys [113, 133] and sound 
awareness systems [131, 174]. These dimensions collectively con-
tribute to the understanding of comfort as a key experience in the 
built environment. For the rest of this paper, when referring to 
comfort, we refer to these four dimensions. 
2.2 Secondary Research on Experiences in the 
Built Environment 
Several works have reviewed literature on human comfort in built 
environments. For example, Frontczak and Wargocki [65] surveyed 
What Do We Design for When We Design “Smart Buildings”? - A Scoping Review of Human 
Experience Design Research in Buildings CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
Figure 1: This flowchart demonstrates the scoping review process and the number of papers considered in each stage. 
how lighting and temperature influence human comfort. Similarly, 
Zhang and Barrett [180] discuss occupant satisfaction with comfort 
dimensions in the context of green office buildings. Few works 
explore human experiences beyond comfort in smart buildings 
through secondary research (i.e. scoping or systematic reviews). 
For example, a review by Pourzolfaghar and Helfert [137] iden-
tifies design challenges in creating smart environments but only 
addresses user experience in broad terms. Aliero et al. [9] explore 
trends in control over automated buildings and smart technologies 
while considering user experience in the context of privacy in au-
tomation systems. Work by Saputra and Ramadhan [147] highlights 
the key components that make up smart buildings, emphasising 
energy management and building information modelling, while 
viewing occupant comfort in the context of improving quality of 
life. Similarly, Latifah et al. [104] connect smart building features 
with smart city frameworks to enhance comfort and transparency 
in meeting digital society’s needs [104]. 
Other reviews focus on specific environments. For example, Bäck-
lund et al. [13] examined campus buildings to explore the relation-
ship between occupant behaviour, building systems, and energy 
use, proposing a framework for assessing the impact of occupant 
behaviour on energy consumption. Ji et al. [96] reviewed sensing 
technologies across six areas—occupancy status, physiological in-
dicators, building components, environment, consumption, and 
multi-sensor fusion—to identify concerns related to privacy and 
data concealment from building occupants. Smart home reviews 
have focused on how users view benefits arising from technology 
in these spaces [112], and the complexity of domestic spaces and 
opportunities around human-home collaboration [117]. Further 
secondary research has examined smart technology adoption by 
ageing populations [110] and communication challenges within 
smart homes for vulnerable groups [94]. To the best of our knowl-
edge, our scoping review is the first of its kind to encompass all 
types of smart environments and consider the full spectrum of 
human experiences beyond traditional notions of comfort. 
3 Methodology 
This work seeks to investigate smart building research to under-
stand what researchers envision and design for. The goal is not 
to provide an exhaustive summary of existing research findings 
but to focus on identifying the human experiences that research in 
this domain aims to improve or introduce. In addition, we identi-
fied how the field aims to shape those human experiences through 
design mechanisms and technological interventions. This was ac-
complished by conducting a scoping review based on the five-stage 
framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [12]. We chose a scop-
ing review as this method suits broad research questions that map key characteristics rather than a targeted study of a specific ef-
fect [126, 143]. The review was planned with pre-defined research 
questions and a search strategy, rather than following a formal 
protocol, allowing the specifics of the analysis to be shaped by the 
first author’s growing familiarity with the literature by reading the 
selected corpus papers. The process is documented in the rest of 
this section. To ensure comprehensive reporting, this paper broadly 
follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) check-
list where applicable1 . Figure 1 provides an overview of the search 
and screening stages to reach the final review corpus. 
3.1 Stage 1: Identifying Research Questions 
During the first stage in our scoping review work, key research 
questions were identified. The first question, established from the 
outset of the project, focuses on the different targeted human expe-
riences in smart buildings: 
• RQ1. What are the different types of human experiences that 
research in the broad domain of smart buildings aims to 
improve or introduce? 
The other two research questions underwent iterations but fo-
cused on the technologies and mechanisms that the field adopts 
from interaction design, architecture, and other areas to improve 
human experiences in smart buildings: 
• RQ2. What are the design methods and approaches employed 
in smart building research to shape human experiences? 
• RQ3. What types of technological interventions are developed 
or conceptualised to enhance human interactive experiences 
in smart buildings? 
3.2 Stage 2: Identifying Relevant Studies 
To ensure that our scoping review investigates disciplines beyond 
the HCI domain, we queried for works in two established databases. 
The ACM Digital Library (DL) primarily features computer science 
and engineering research (including HCI). Scopus offers multidis-
ciplinary coverage, with frequent indexing of architecture works, 
making it a valuable resource for architecture studies on smart 
building research2 . 
3.2.1 Pilot Searches. We first conducted pilot searches on smart 
buildings and experiences, which resulted in some 9000 references 
in Scopus alone. We reviewed the first 20%, finding many irrelevant

provide a table in the supplementary materials to detail the manner by which we 
adhere to the reporting checklist.

CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Rao et al. 
Figure 2: The search comprised seven queries (Query 1 – Query 7), combining nine components ((a)–(i)). The nine components 
were either 1) environment/domain-specific descriptors (first column), 2) a keyword for experience (second column), or 3) a 
keyword for interaction (third column). We conducted the searches using combinations of these—query list on the right. Thus, 
environmental descriptors were combined with experience and interaction keywords (red line). This was implemented for 
"Built environment" separately—(a) in red box—as this yielded many results, while more specific terms were combined in a 
second search—(b) in red box. Domain-specific descriptors were handled separately again—(c) and (d) in green box; green line. 
When the domain-specific descriptor already included the word interaction (e.g. ’human-building interaction’), the query was 
only accompanied by the experience keyword—(e), (f), and (g) in blue box; blue line. 
studies that did not involve human experiences, such as Internet of 
Things (IoT) and civil and computational engineering. Based on this, 
we decided to include interaction (interac* ) in our search strategy 
to refer to interactive human experiences in smart buildings. 
3.2.2 Employed Search Queries. Our search queries are explained 
in Figure 2. The search involved seven queries (Query 1–Query 7), 
structured around three keyword categories: 1) environment/domain-
specific descriptors, 2) experience, and 3) interaction keywords. We 
conducted the searches using a combination of the keyword groups. 
A combination with “built environment” was searched separately 
due to the large volume of results, while more specific environ-
mental descriptors—(b) in Figure 2—were combined in a second 
search. Domain-specific descriptors were handled individually, and 
when these already included interaction (e.g. “human-building in-
teraction”), only experience keywords were added. An example of 
a search query (applied to Scopus) is: "BUILT ENVIRONMENT*" AND 
EXPERIEN* AND INTERAC* . The complete list of queries we used 
are included in the supplementary materials. 
We conducted the searches based on papers’ keywords, abstract, 
and title across both databases3 . This generated 5,526 references 
across both sources, collected during April – May 2024 (later in-
creased by 22 papers through snowballing [14], see Figure 1). 
3.3 Stage 3: Study Selection 
During our pilot search, we developed initial inclusion-exclusion 
(I/E) criteria for the first (title and abstract) screening stage, refining 
them as we grew familiar with the literature. Broadly, references 
were included if they: (1) were set within the context of a smart 
building, (2) discussed human experiences, and (3) explored the use 
or potential use of technologies. References solely focused on engi-
neering, algorithms, or building design without addressing human 
3Scopus supports a combined search of titles, abstracts, and keywords. In contrast, the 
ACM DL requires these parameters to be searched separately. To ensure consistency 
and comparability, we conducted separate searches within the ACM DL: first by titles, 
then by abstracts, and finally by keywords, before collating the results. interaction or the use of technology were excluded. In addition, we 
excluded papers that were not in English and secondary research 
(e.g. meta-reviews). The first author applied the I/E criteria to the 
5,548 citations, reading all associated abstracts, keywords, and ti-
tles. If the relevance of a study was unclear from the abstract, the 
study was retained for a full article review. This process resulted in 
368 shortlisted abstracts. After a review by the last author and the 
removal of duplicate studies, 338 abstracts were shortlisted for full-
paper screening. For the latter, the criteria established for inclusion 
and exclusion were specified and expanded: 
(1) We included studies around human interaction within smart 
buildings using any form of technology for occupants. Con-
versely, we excluded studies that focused on technology 
development without clear relevance to user interaction or 
experience, such as works on theoretical models, architec-
tural frameworks, or technical optimisations. 
(2) Our research focuses on real-world environments, however, 
we incorporated papers that utilise Virtual Reality (VR), Aug-
mented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR) to augment 
existing spaces, enhancing spatial experiences and smart 
building capacities [7, 99]. However, we excluded research 
focused on designing purely virtual environments or those 
centred on gaming realism and virtual worlds without con-
nection to physical space. 
(3) We included papers that examined human experiences within 
smart buildings and building façades. However, we excluded 
papers focused on outdoor experiences like hiking, cycling, 
and city walks. Additionally, automotive contexts were ex-
cluded as they fall outside the scope of smart buildings. 
(4) We excluded papers on domotics, mobile apps, and Conver-
sational User Interfaces (CUIs) that lacked a focus on spatial 
factors of human experience or interaction within a smart 
building. Studies on human-robot interaction without con-
nection to physical space were also excluded.

Figure 3: To examine the suitability and the terminology of the targeted human experiences, primary design mechanisms, 
and technological interventions, we structured them in a sentence, illustrated in this diagram. For example, a paper might be 
described in the form of “In this paper, Environmental Sensing is used as a way to support Comfort through Personalisation”. 
The first and last authors held discussions to resolve any points of 
confusion throughout the study selection. After reading the articles 
in full and cross-checking references cited by the selected papers 
that may have been accidentally left out, a total of 192 articles 
were selected for inclusion in the scoping review. 
3.4 Stage 4: Charting the Data 
The next stage involved charting key items from the selected pa-
pers. Our charting approach was akin to a “descriptive-analytical 
narrative review” [12], where a common analytical framework was 
applied to the papers, enabling us to systematically collect and 
analyse standard information from each study. The first and last au-
thors collaboratively developed a charting table template to capture 
information related to the research questions. This process involved 
categorisation (labelling) and extraction of relevant sentences for 
later analysis. While some papers were straightforward to chart, 
others involved multiple discussions to satisfactorily capture the 
research perspectives. 
Our template recorded title, author(s), publication year, publi-
cation source/venue, publication type and type of smart building 
addressed. We structured our template to record items directly 
related to our research questions. We documented research motiva-
tions, and methodologies including research and design methodolo-
gies to infer whether the research was qualitative, quantitative, or 
mixed-methods. We recorded the interactive technologies and any 
instruments used to assess the environments or their users. Central 
to our research, we noted the aspects of human experience discussed. 
Key findings and the papers’ visions for future were also recorded 
(in case we needed to examine evidence supporting claims made 
by the studies), but were considered out of scope for this paper. 
The charting template with an example entry is included in Table 4. 
Throughout this iterative process, the research team met regularly 
to discuss the scope of the review, refine definitions, and ensure 
consistency in the categorisation of information. 
3.5 Stage 5: Collating, Summarising, and 
Reporting 
After charting the study data, we analysed it in two main stages: a 
descriptive summary followed by an interpretive analysis (semantic 
and latent approaches) [36]. First, we examined the characteristics 
of the literature such as the venues they were published at. Next, 
we adopted a hybrid latent coding approach, based on thematic 
analysis [30], to analyse the charting table. This approach was 
hybrid because while we employed an inductive process to cre-
ate new codes and themes, we also incorporated deductive coding 
for the four dimensions of comfort that we adopted from existing literature [5] as well as Brand [28]’s shearing layers (details de-
scribed below). The coding was highly iterative and completed over 
multiple rounds by the first author, with intermittent discussions 
with the full research team, eventually resulting in overarching 
themes for the targeted human experiences. Though targeted hu-
man experiences are the resulting themes, the other core categories 
(design mechanisms and technological interventions) were iterated 
on as well. Our method borrows from reflexive thematic analysis in 
the organic, flexible nature of the rounds of iteration of codes and 
themes, but overall is better aligned with a codebook approach [29]. 
In line with our research questions, we identified key themes 
around human experiences in smart buildings by coding papers 
based on the primary experiences they targeted. After identifying 
the targeted experiences, we recognised that the papers could be 
analysed for the design measure or approach (hereafter referred to 
as design mechanism) used to achieve that experience. We devel-
oped RQ2 and conducted a second round of this analysis where we 
coded each paper for the primary design mechanisms employed 
to achieve the targeted human experiences. For our third research 
question, we categorised the technology data by type, iteratively 
grouping them based on observed commonalities and patterns. We 
also coded the papers based on their technologies’ positioning in 
Brand [28]’s shearing layers which describe distinct layers of a build-
ing based on its temporal lifespan [28]. Finally, the full research 
team finalised the resulting themes of targeted human experiences, 
design mechanisms, and types of technological interventions over 
two meetings. These discussions considered the suitability and ter-
minology of these themes in the form of the example sentences 
presented in Figure 3. The full list of corpus papers and the analysis 
process are documented in the supplementary materials. 
4 Findings 
This section presents a descriptive overview of the literature, the 
thematic analysis of targeted human experiences (RQ1), design 
mechanisms (RQ2), and technological interventions (RQ3). These 
are also summarised in Table 1. 
4.1 Characteristics of the Literature 
In line with general publication increases, the distribution of the 
192 papers in our corpus by publication year shows a growing trend 
that peaked in 2019, coinciding with the ACM ToCHI special issue 
on human-building interaction (HBI) [3] (Figure 7a in the appen-
dix). The reviewed papers predominantly explored smart homes 
(24%) or smart buildings (20%). Smart offices (17%) and educational 
spaces (15%) also received attention, along with specific locations 
like places of worship, historical sites, children’s play areas (19%),

primarily from conferences (56%) followed by journal articles (19%), 
as shown in Figure 7c. Within conference publications, 22% of works 
were published at ACM CHI, otherwise appearing in a variety of 
HCI and HCI-adjacent conferences as well as architecture and built 
environments conferences (Figure 7d). 
4.2 The Targeted Human Experiences in Smart 
Buildings 
We identified 11 key themes corresponding to distinct human ex-
periences within smart buildings, presented in Table 1(a). While 
we aimed to identify the primary and overarching human experi-
ence targeted in each paper, it was not always possible to assign 
works to a single experience. In those cases, papers were assigned 
to multiple themes. Specifically, six papers addressed three differ-
ent human experiences (e.g. [162]), 90 targeted two (e.g. [185]), 
and the remaining 96 focused on a single experience. We provide a 
high-level overview of the experiences below. Detailed descriptions, 
including the number of papers addressing each experience and 
prototypical examples, can be found in Table 2. For readability, all 
targeted human experiences are in bold for the rest of this paper. 
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the established concept of Comfort was 
one of the most targeted human experiences. Emotional Experi-
ences and Explorative and/or Future and Speculative Experiences 
were similarly common. In the former, spaces aimed to elicit affec-
tive states, sentiments, and moods In Explorative and/or Future 
and Speculative Experiences, papers did not target a specific ex-
perience. These works often use design probes to test speculative 
ideas, presenting novel concepts to explore their impact on human 
experiences [58, 173]. One work captures the essence of this: "The 
interpretation of that situation is left to the people who encounter the 
[system]" [70], illustrating the open-ended nature of these explo-
rations. Works also focused on Bodily Experiences, exploring how 
technology can create environments that adapt to and reflect users’ 
physical presence and/or enhance their sense of bodily awareness. 
Other experiences included users’ Sense of Place-making. 
Here, technology was designed to encourage occupants’ to create 
places out of spaces [78]. Experiences of Relatedness emphasise building a connection between people in a space, e.g. social pres-
ence or intimacy. Democratic Experiences were shaped by recent 
discussions in HCI about preserving and fostering democratic val-
ues within smart buildings [53]—this work amplifies inhabitant 
voices and highlights a shared impact on the space. Inclusion 
Experiences focus on environments in which users with diverse 
needs are taken care of; it is the outcome of accessible and inclusive 
design [141]. Aesthetic Experiences target sensory perception 
through manipulation of (largely) audiovisual features. 
Fewer works explored Learning and Teaching Experiences 
which involves creating educational interactions, such as enhanc-
ing student-teacher engagement. Similarly, Sense of Orientation 
refers to experiences related to navigating and understanding one’s 
position within the environment, including wayfinding. Figure 4 
highlights a resurgence in comfort-focused research from 2017, in-
fluenced by HBI’s introduction of comfort through a human-centred 
lens [5]. Figure 8 in the appendix provides an overview of research 
trends, beginning with Harrison and Dourish [78]’s work on the 
roles of place and space.

What Do We Design for When We Design “Smart Buildings”? - A Scoping Review of Human 
Experience Design Research in Buildings CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
Table 2: The 11 human experiences in smart buildings following the analysis of our charting table. We provide a name for the 
targeted experience and explain what we mean. We share the number of papers that were identified as targeting the experience 
with a few prototypical examples for each. 
The Targeted Experience Description N Prototypical Examples 
Aesthetic Experience Technological and aesthetic considerations transform atmospheres 
within smart built environments, resulting in specific experiences 
of their aesthetics. Departing from classical notions of beauty [37], 
this research emphasises the creation of sensory experiential qualities 
through the manipulation of sound, light, and space. 18 InBloom introduces a playful ambience using breathing 
elements and light-based interactions [101]. Synesthesia 
attempts to replicate the perceptual phenomenon of the 
same name, utilising touch and visual stimuli to create 
cross-sensory experiences to evoke a perception of body 
as one with the object [8]. 
Bodily Experience The physical body’s role in creating and sustaining experiences is fos-
tered or enabled through the integration of technology. This research 
explores how physical movements and gestures such as touching, mov-
ing, or manipulating artifacts, as well as the body’s presence, can both 
influence and be influenced by the surrounding environment [84]. 23 The SKIN bodysuit translates wireless signals from the 
environment into vibro-tactile responses to change the 
perception of space around the body [167]. In the Dress 
Room, a responsive cube moves towards or away from the 
dancer’s body to create intimacy as well as encourage the 
dancer to reflect on their motions and movement. [165]. 
Comfort Occupant comfort, in its traditional sense, is defined by human per-
ception across four environmental dimensions: thermal, visual, air 
quality, and acoustic [2]. In HCI, comfort is understood through users’ 
decisions to adjust these dimensions—including the type of adjustment 
(e.g. increasing or decreasing) or choosing not to adjust—as well as the 
absence of discomfort [19]. 47 The ActuAir Room Divider Display visualises real-time 
air quality data, raising occupant awareness of their sur-
rounding environment [111]. The PrisMe tangible user 
interface aids users in understanding and managing sur-
rounding sounds, enhancing their control over auditory 
experiences in the space [131]. 
Democratic Experience Technology fosters a sense of community and democratic engagement 
by empowering users to shape their smart building environment [ 53]. 
Through physical and digital actions, users contribute to civic inclusiv-
ity, occupant privacy, and resilience by making decisions and engaging 
with those of others. This extends to building activism, where actions 
like comfort management allow users to collectively shape their sur-
roundings in alignment with shared values. 16 ThermoKiosk ’s voting device creates a sense of commu-
nity by allowing users to voice concerns in automated 
workspaces and facilitating participation in building 
decision-making [47]. The Exo Building creates a simi-
lar experience through privacy and data control via an 
adaptive smart façades [149]. 
Explorative and/or Future 
and Speculative Experiences Exploratory works that push the boundaries of what is possible in smart 
building environments. It is characterised by uncertainty and openness, 
where researchers and designers do not have predefined expectations 
of the experience but seek to discover how users engage with novel 
ideas, technologies, or spaces. For this, works employ speculative or 
futuring concepts or design probes, observing how they adapt, react, 
interact, and experience in unforeseen ways. Leveraging open-ended 
experimentation, this theme encourages users to explore and co-create 
future possibilities, revealing insights into how they might live in and 
experience smart environments yet to be fully imagined. 48 WindowWall examines users’ future experiences of adap-
tive and smart windows as ubiquitous displays at home 
through speculative sessions followed by low-fidelity 
design probes [15]. The Pendaphonics project explores 
futuristic ways for using architecture for urban revi-
talisation, public engagement, expression, and perfor-
mance [77]. By integrating a physical-digital-sonic pen-
dulum into a public space, it invites visitors to interact 
with an installation that blends movement, sound, and 
digital interaction. 
Emotional Experience Exploring how spaces can support the emotional aspects of human 
experiences in smart buildings. Following Picard [136] ’s definition of 
affect in HCI, emotion encompasses emotional states (e.g. valence and 
arousal), sentiments (e.g. positivity), and moods (e.g. discontentment). 
It includes bodily states when measured as physiological responses. 38 LiveNature integrates living walls and blooming mechan-
ical flowers to evoke calming and restorative experiences 
[61]. The Arup Sentiment Cocoon displays collective emo-
tions in workspaces for shared experiences to foster col-
lective emotional responses [20]. 
Experience of Relatedness Creating a sense of connection and belonging between individuals, 
whether co-located or remote, through technology [172]. For this, 
works try to support development of deeper emotional bonds, mutual 
understanding, and social support between occupants in the built 
environment. 21 Ghosting captures multi-modal social presence and ca-
sual interactions via lights and audio to create connected-
ness between remote users [77]. The Hide and Seek Wall-
paper invites adults and children to build social bonds 
through play [83]. 
Inclusion Experience Environments that are experienced as catering to the diverse cognitive, 
sensory, and physical needs of users, for example with particular at-
tention to neuro-diversity (e.g. autism or ADHD) and sensory (mainly 
auditory and visual) impairments. 13 NavTiles explores tactile guiding surfaces for non-visual 
navigation for blind travellers [157]. PLAYSCAPE [1] and 
the Magic Room [69] create responsive environments 
that support therapeutic and social play for children with 
autism, to improve motor planning and social function. 
Learning and Teaching Ex-
perience The experiences resulting from interactions, activities, and environ-
ments that contribute to the educational and learning process within a 
smart building. 9 The EvoRoom is a rain-forest simulation utilising large-
scale displays to foster collective inquiry among students 
and enhance teacher-student engagement [108]. 
Sense of Place-making How smart building users experience places as meaningful through 
cultural, social, and sensory engagement. These experiences are facili-
tated by embodied experiences between people and their environment 
through technology [78]. 23 The Robotic Wall changes spatial configurations based 
on users needs to instil a sense of meaning in the spatial 
arrangement [129]. Within the Walls of York Gaol utilised 
AR to connect visitors with the prison by experiencing 
stories of prisoners lives [18]. 
Sense of Orientation Technology-enhanced methods that influence how people experience 
spatial orientation as part of navigation, including identifying land-
marks, detecting surface-level changes, and wayfinding. 8 Footsteps uses projection-based displays to visualise peo-
ples’ historical presence to influence navigation in unfa-
miliar environments [6].

Table 3: The 10 primary design mechanisms in smart buildings. We provide a name for each design mechanism and explain 
its meaning. Additionally, we share the number of papers that employed the mechanism in their work, along with a few 
prototypical examples. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between the design mechanisms and the targeted human 
experiences by listing the top three most frequently appearing experiences for which the design mechanism was employed. 
The Design Mechanism Description N Prototypical Examples Associated Targeted Experiences 
(n=3) 
Community and Social Con-
nection Enhancing communal experiences in shared spaces by promoting so-
cially motivated domestic practices (such as recalling events of the day 
during dinner), relationships, and collaboration among smart building 
occupants. 40 The Tableau Machine system was designed for 
spontaneous family bonding through abstract vi-
sualisations [138]. Ghosting supports distant in-
teractions using lights and audio to enhance social 
presence at home [45]. Experience of Relatedness (n=18), 
Emotional Experiences (n=5), Com-
fort (n=5) 
Spatial Design The arrangement and manipulation of physical space to optimise func-
tionality and facilitate spatial appropriation, where space becomes a 
medium for enabling interaction. This approach views space as a dy-
namic, relational entity, involving interactions between objects, bodies, 
and environmental elements [60]. 34 Diffusive Geometries creates vapour-based walls 
as an alternative and flexible way of separat-
ing spaces [55]. Adaptive partitioning uses aug-
mented reality to dynamically divide open-plan 
workspaces. Explorative and/or Future and 
Speculative (n=13), Comfort (n=9), 
Sense of Place-making (n=9) 
Technological Immersion Utilising the immersive properties of technologies such as large am-
bient displays, VR, AR, and mixed reality (MR) to create simulated or 
technologically mediated experiences within the context of the smart 
building. These technologies envelop users in visual and/or auditory 
environments for simulating spaces or providing access to experiences 
that are otherwise unattainable in the physical building [154]. 22 The Magic Room uses digitally enhanced physical 
materials and ambient embedded devices to create 
an an interactive environment for gently stimu-
lating primary school children [69]. Live Building 
uses virtual reality to study the design of large-
scale, shape-changing interfaces [7]. Emotional Experiences (n=4), Ex-
plorative and/or Future and Specu-
lative (n=4), Comfort (n=4) 
Playful Design The use of game-like interactions to transform everyday spaces into 
lively, engaging experiences, adding an element of surprise, discovery 
and unexpectedness to the smart building. 22 Squeeze and MurMur Moderators are chairs that 
enable playful re-discovery of family memories 
[135] or workplace communication [130]. Explorative and/or Future and 
Speculative (n=9), Sense of Place-
making (n=7), Aesthetic Experi-
ences (n=5) 
Environmental and Social 
Information Surfacing or augmenting data related to environmental conditions 
such as air quality and temperature or socially relevant information 
such as occupancy and movement. This design mechanism surfaces 
information that might otherwise be overlooked, helping occupants 
gain a deeper understanding and awareness of their surroundings. 21 PrisMe Tangible Environment helps users under-
stand and manage surrounding sounds [131]. Lu-
mina and Cloud, a kinetic canopy that responds 
to environmental changes [145]. Comfort (n=10), Explorative and/or 
Future and Speculative (n=5), Emo-
tional Experiences (n=4) 
Somaesthetic Design The incorporation of the body and movement into the design of the 
smart building, where bodily interactions are both the mechanism and 
the ultimate experience. This approach priorities bodily awareness 
and sensory engagement, focusing on the body’s sensations within 
the smart building space [85]. 17 Freequent Traveller is a swinging hammock whose 
rhythmic movement inspires the notion of “wan-
dering about” in the mind as well as physically 
from the motion [56]. SonicTaiChi promotes work-
place restoration with sonic-guided bodily move-
ments [92]. Bodily Experiences (n=14), Explo-
rative and/or Future and Specula-
tive (n=2), Sense of Place-making 
(n=1) 
Participation and Co-design Creating solutions from the users’ perspective by actively involving 
them in shaping and influencing their environment. This mechanism 
covers both methods like participatory design and design elements 
that result in participation. This approach fosters a sense of ownership 
and empowerment through shared decision-making, resulting in envi-
ronments that are aligned with the occupants’ values. 17 VoteBox and CoolDesk are participatory devices 
for allowing users to voice their concerns for man-
aging thermal environments [119]. The Sensing 
Mobile App supports comfort management by al-
lowing users to share their preferences around 
comfort to building information systems [95]. Democratic Experiences (n=13), 
Comfort (n=3), Explorative and/or 
Future and Speculative (n=1) 
Personalisation Gathering and understanding the nature of users’ subjective prefer-
ences and needs in (often shared and communal) indoor spaces across 
various contexts. The goal being that such occupants requirements and 
behaviours may be used to provide control over typically automated 
building features—such as lighting, temperature, and other environ-
mental controls—to suit their individual preferences. 16 Interface characteristics of a shared lighting sys-
tems in office environments was evaluated for 
user experience in social settings [166]. Domes-
tic energy interfaces were examined for how 
lower-income households personalise their en-
vironments and manage comfort [54]. Comfort (n=12), Explorative and/or 
Future and Speculative (n=2), Sense 
of Place-making (n=1) 
N.A. Works that do not explicitly apply or mention a specific design mech-
anism or discussed several at once, very broadly. The aim is to posit 
novel understandings or assess and critique current knowledge and 
technologies. 12 Works positing novel insights such as seminal 
works on Places and Spaces [78], and theoretical 
assessment of multi-sensory interactive space de-
sign for autistic children [151]. Explorative and/or Future and Spec-
ulative (n=6), Inclusion Experiences 
(n=2), Aesthetic Experiences (n=2) 
Biophilic Design This approach fosters occupants’ connection with nature by integrat-
ing natural elements into the built environment, whether through 
direct connections, nature-inspired elements, or symbolic representa-
tions. It leverages the innate human affinity for life and living systems, 
incorporating them into smart buildings to enhances physical and 
emotional health [88]. 9 Interactive Window Display is an intelligent screen 
system for viewing nature scenes in smart homes 
[171]. Soft Oscillating LaLang, Blooming Dande-
lions, and Lotus-like Flowers are soft robotic struc-
tures designed for capturing peoples’ attention in 
public spaces [43]. Emotional Experiences (n=8), Bod-

4.3 Design Mechanisms For Smart Buildings 
To understand the 11 targeted experiences, we analysed common 
design approaches aimed at creating them. We identified 20 design 
mechanisms (italicised in the paper), listed in Figure 5. Our analysis 
found that that four papers addressed three different design mech-
anisms, 57 targeted two, and 131 focused on a single mechanism. 
Notably, 12 framing/vision papers did not specify any design mech-
anism and were marked as not applicable (N.A.). We focus here 
on the ten most frequently used design mechanisms described in detail in Table 3, with the number of associated papers, prototypical 
examples, and the most common associated human experience. 
Our design mechanisms encompass methods, approaches, tech-
niques, elements, and processes, individually or in combination. 
With no universal definition in existing literature, we inclusively 
categorised works across all types of design mechanisms. For ex-
ample, Biophilic Design can include elements like vegetation [106], 
processes for integrating these elements into architecture [33], or 
innovative approaches such as organic user interfaces [127]. Papers 
like Chooi et al. [43] combine techniques (oscillating soft robotics), 
elements (flora-inspired design), and methods (symbiosis concepts)

Figure 5: An overview of the targeted human experiences in smart buildings, along with their associated design mechanisms, 
and technological interventions. These human experiences, which are the primary focus of our scoping review, serve as the the 
starting point of this visualisation, linking to design mechanisms on one side and technological interventions on the other, 
enabled by human experiences. Figure A presents an unfolded version of this visualisation, separating the connections into two 
distinct plots: one illustrating the relationships between human experiences and design mechanisms, and the other between 
human experiences and technological interventions. 
to foster nature connections. Our cataloguing promotes an inclu-
sive understanding of how design mechanisms enhance human 
experiences in smart buildings4 . 
A distinct pattern emerges: some mechanisms are versatile, sup-
porting multiple experiences, while others are closely tied to spe-
cific ones. For instance, Playful Design, with elements like surprise 
[135] or storytelling [82], supports experiences such as Explo-
rative and/or Future and Speculative, Sense of Place-making, 
and Aesthetic Experiences. Similarly, Technological Immersion 
spans diverse experiences. In contrast, mechanisms like Commu-
nity and Social Connection focus on specific experiences, such as 
Experiences of Relatedness, fostering cultural identity [128]. So-
maesthetic Design supports Bodily Experiences, emphasising hu-
man presence [178]. Environmental and Social Information, Spatial 
Design, and Personalisation enhance Comfort by allowing environ-
mental adjustments [132]. Biophilic Design connects to Emotional 
Experiences, and Participation and Co-design promotes civic inclu -
sion for Democratic Experiences. 
The most common design mechanisms aside from Community 
and Social Connection were traditional architecture-related design 
mechanisms like Spatial Design, alongside mechanisms established 
and grounded in HCI such as Technological Immersion, Playful De-
sign, the provision of Environmental and Social Information, and 
Participation and Co-design. This prevalence points to the position 
of smart building research between architecture and Interaction 
Design, which we discuss further in Section 5. Figure 5 illustrates 
4The relationship between targeted human experiences and design mechanisms can 
be conceptualised similar to the distinction between “space” and “place”, as articulated 
by Harrison and Dourish [78]. In this context, design mechanisms can be perceived as 
“opportunities” to create or shape the “understood reality” of targeted experiences. the relationship between the targeted human experiences in smart 
buildings and the corresponding design mechanisms employed. 
4.4 Typologies of Technological Interventions 
in Smart Buildings 
We analysed the technological interventions across all works in 
our scoping review, categorising them into seven types. Out of 
192 papers, 153 incorporated technological interventions in their 
exploration of human experiences in smart buildings. The remain-
ing 39 papers did not directly employ technological interventions 
but rather presented conceptual ideas and potential theoretical 
solutions. While design mechanisms offer strategies for creating 
or enabling meaningful experiences, technological interventions 
refer to the tools and systems used to implement these mechanisms 
in practice. In this section, we share the two typologies around 
technology that we developed. The first typology categorises the 
technological interventions discussed in the papers. Similar to the 
previous typologies on human experiences (Table 2) and design 
mechanisms (Table 3), these categories are illustrated with proto-
typical examples and the top three associated human experiences 
in Table 5 in the appendix. The second typology is based on Brand 
[28]’s shearing layers which describes distinct layers of a building 
based on its temporal lifespan [28]. 
4.4.1 Types of Technological Interventions. Audiovisual (and some-
times haptic) modalities were common interventions. Interactive 
Displays were the most frequent intervention type. Similarly, Audio 
and Lighting technologies used sound and light as primary tech-
nologies to introduce novel interactions and experiences [10]. To 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Rao et al. 
address comfort, Environmental Sensing was frequently combined 
with IoT-connected sensors to monitor environmental conditions 
[49]. Motors and actuators were combined with everyday materials 
(such as neoprene fabric [59]) in Shape-changing and Kinetic Inter-
faces to introduce dynamic-physical changes that allowed spaces to 
respond to user presence and activities. Next, Augmented and Vir-
tual Reality (AR/VR) and Physiological Sensing interventions were 
primarily used for data collection on user responses to aspects of the 
smart building [11, 34]. AR/VR technologies are discussed as a tech-
nological intervention but are also a component of Technological 
Immersion design mechanism (Table 3). As a technological inter-
vention, they serve as tools for simulating future smart spaces. In 
contrast, as part of the Technological Immersion design mechanism, 
they are one among various technologies (e.g. large displays) that 
enable immersive experiences. Finally, Feedback Systems enabled 
users to exchange information with the smart building, helping 
them understand and personalise their environment through data 
collection and participatory apps [121]. 
Figure 6: The smart building layers adopted from Brand [28]’s 
shearing layers. In our scoping review, we find the Space Plan 
to be the largest layer in contrast to the Site layer that has no 
interventions. We additionally define the Extended Reality 
Space layer to accommodate a new layer of temporality that 
represents the use of extended reality with smart buildings. 
4.4.2 The Temporal Layers of the Smart Building. We also posi-
tioned technologies following Brand [28]’s “Shearing layers” (Fig-
ure 6). Brand describes six distinct layers of a building based on 
its temporal lifespan: Site, Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and 
Stuff [28]. The majority of interventions were concentrated in 
the Space Plan (n = 41) and Stuff (n = 38) layers. This aligns with 
their transient and flexible nature, making them ideal for smart 
building technologies and prototypes that do not require major 
structural changes such as smart furniture, moving walls, and inter-
active floors. The Services layer (n = 33), traditionally encompassing 
HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, was reappropriated to in-
clude technologies related to occupant comfort: air quality, thermal 
conditions, lighting, and acoustics. 
The Skin (n = 17) and Structure (n = 3) layers saw fewer interven-
tions, reflecting their enduring and foundational nature. The Skin 
layer—encompassing façades and exteriors—is periodically updated, 
but less frequently than more adaptable layers. Interventions in the Structure layer, which includes foundations and load-bearing 
elements, are scarce due to the complexity and expense of alter-
ing these fundamental components. Unsurprisingly, smart building 
technologies tend to focus on layers that can be modified more eas-
ily, leaving structural changes largely to traditional architectural 
and engineering domains. There were no interventions categorised 
under the Site layer. This absence reflects that this layer, concerned 
with the building’s geographical location and context, falls outside 
the immediate focus of smart building technologies. Urban HCI 
work often addresses connections to the site of the building [63], 
but such considerations extend beyond the scope of our review. 
To accommodate works that extend physical space using aug-
mented and virtual means, we introduced the Extended Reality 
Space (n = 21) layer. This addition reflects the growing importance 
of technologies that expand the physical confines of traditional 
building layers. Unlike traditional building layers bound by mate-
rial lifespans, the Extended Reality Space operates independently 
of physical constraints. It introduces a dynamic layer to building 
temporality, where digital and virtual environments such as AR/VR 
can be updated or transformed almost instantaneously. It interacts 
with physical elements without altering them (apart from using 
devices like headsets necessary to perceive virtual content), provid-
ing temporal flexibility in which both temporary and permanent 
digital interventions coexist. 
5 Discussion of Findings: Insights into Current 
Smart Building Research 
We now discuss our findings to elicit higher-level understandings 
and implications. We wish to share messages that can inform re-
search that seeks to design human experiences in smart buildings. 
5.1 Beyond Comfort—The Diversity of Targeted 
Human Experiences in Smart Building Research 
In our exploration of human experiences in smart buildings, we 
identified 11 distinct experiences around human experiences in 
smart building research. This reflects an evolving understanding 
of what it means to design a smart building and extends it sub-
stantially beyond the traditionally examined experience of comfort. 
For example, Learning and Teaching Experiences highlight the 
potential of smart buildings as educational tools that create inter-
active learning environments which support curiosity and innova-
tion [108]. Although Comfort remains a major focus, it is often 
addressed through novel means such as Personalisation [ 139] and 
Spatial Design [129], as well as fostering Community and Social Con-
nections [132] to target individual and collective well-being. This 
diversity of targeted human experiences beyond comfort sheds light 
on the major challenges and questions that need to be addressed 
for the development of the field. For example, what design methods 
must we develop or adopt to conceptualise emotionally-rich [140] 
or “somatic” environments [8]? How can we design for meaningful 
yet highly subjective Inclusion Experiences in smart buildings, 
catering to those with diverse sensory needs [1, 157]? The same 
question is valid for evaluation methods to assess the impact of 
technological interventions on these targeted human experiences.

Experience Design Research in Buildings CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
5.2 Alignment with Trends in HCI 
Our analysis reveals strong connections between human experience 
design in smart buildings and long-established HCI research, partic-
ularly in the use of Community and Social Connection as a key design 
measure for the Experience of Relatedness among occupants. 
Smart buildings can foster social connection between occupants 
through technologies like multimodal communication systems for 
remote users [77] and features that enhance co-located social bond-
ing [128]. These works emphasise the potential of smart buildings 
to bridge physical and digital spaces, enhancing social connected-
ness across diverse contexts. However, several targeted experiences 
in smart buildings also align with some of the more recent and 
growing trends in HCI research and related fields, including Bod-
ily Experiences, Explorative and/or Future and Speculative, and 
Democratic Experiences. 
Bodily Experiences emphasise the role of multi-sensorial per-
ception of the environment in shaping interactions within smart 
buildings, as well as mutual influences of the human body and 
spaces that can be studied and designed for, using methods of So-
maesthetic Design. This builds on an architectural legacy in which 
the human body—its scale, directionality, proportionality, etc.—is 
the main source of inspiration and reference for spatial design [153]. 
We observe an alignment between the proliferation of works recog-
nising the importance of bodily experiences in smart buildings with 
recent discourses and design instances surrounding Somaesthetic 
Design in HCI and IxD research. 
Explorative and/or Future and Speculative Experiences cap-
tures a body of work that aims to (re-)define how people experience 
and re-experience home and public spaces in novel and previously 
un-imagined ways by deploying design probes [71] or speculative 
inquiry [ 66]. This experience is particularly relevant as it expands 
the concept of interaction beyond traditional interfaces, incorporat-
ing the Spatial Design of the smart building itself as a medium for 
digital engagement. It aligns with the evolving discourse on archi-
tectonic interaction, which involves “Interaction Design at the scale 
of architecture” and the “design of architectonic elements with in-
teractive capabilities” [173]. As we increasingly occupy spaces with 
digital technologies, this concept becomes essential for exploring 
how these environments are created and experienced. 
Finally, Democratic Experiences reflects recent efforts in HCI 
to cultivate and preserve democratic values within the context 
of smart buildings [53]. This work views smart buildings as civic 
spaces that foster dialogue between occupants and their environ-
ment, enabling greater user agency, participation, and control, while 
empowering users to actively shape their surroundings [53]. This 
theme builds on research in Participation and co-design, while situ-
ating itself within the relatively new domains of smart cities and 
civic technologies, and critical design as mechanisms in HCI for 
co-shaping interactive spaces through occupant involvement. 
5.3 The Influences of Interaction Design and 
Architecture in Smart Building Research 
Our findings suggest that smart building research has been shaped 
by both IxD and architecture, driving the field forward in three 
ways: (1) by re-appropriating concepts such as personalisation that 
draw heavily from the traditions of IxD [109], (2) by learning from space design principles rooted in the legacy of architecture [81], 
with a focus on the ability to “experiment” with how technology 
can introduce new forms of interactive experiences to our living 
spaces (e.g. through Explorative and/or Future and Speculative 
approaches [158]), and (3) by bringing together the two disciplines: 
while architecture provides the physical and cultural context, IxD 
enhances these spaces with interactive elements that foster connec-
tion and identity, e.g. enabling a Sense of Placemaking [8]. This 
fluidity between the two disciplines highlights the multidisciplinary 
nature of the smart building field which benefits from a collabora-
tive approach to synthesising insights from multiple domains. By 
the same token, these observations raise important questions about 
what other knowledge could be transferred to smart building re-
search. What concepts from other disciplines have yet to make their 
way into smart buildings? By exploring and opening new channels 
for interdisciplinary exchange, smart building research can con-
tinue to evolve, drawing on a broader range of ideas to shape the 
future of our smart buildings. For example, notions around digital 
rights (developed under the domain of digital philosophies [105]) in 
online spaces could offer opportunities to address the challenges of 
smart buildings, which may collect data both voluntarily and invol-
untarily from occupants. Specifically, data portability [105] could 
allow occupants to transfer their data preferences (e.g. lighting or 
temperature settings) between smart buildings, ensuring continuity 
and minimal data collection (as data gets collected once and re-used 
across different buildings [164]). Similarly, smart buildings could 
enable “guest modes” (similar to online browsing experiences) to 
minimise data collection, privacy zones where sensors are deac-
tivated, or informed consent mechanisms alongside transparency 
dashboards to display building data usage policies [146]. 
5.4 The Integration of Artificial Intelligence in 
Human-Centred Smart Buildings 
Despite the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and its 
emergent applications in smart building design—such as building 
resource management, building information modelling [52], and 
building security [73]—there is very limited to almost no integra-
tion of technologies like generative AI and large language models 
(LLMs) for designing human experiences in smart buildings. When 
AI is integrated with human interaction, it primarily focuses on 
creating responsive and personalised environments. The use of AI 
was noted in Comfort experiences [177, 181] and considered in 
Emotional Experiences [140]. Among the reviewed works, 14 
utilised machine learning (ML) for example in tasks like adjusting 
temperature settings based on user behaviour [177] (comfort). Other 
examples where ML is used include Zhao et al. [181] ’s “Mediated 
Atmospheres” or Andres et al. [10] ’s “System of a Sound” transform 
environments by digitally controlling lighting, sound, and video 
projections, creating spaces that interact with human emotions. 
In addition, some works consider (but do not implement) the 
role of AI in futuristic concepts (like empathic buildings [140]) that 
could adjust spaces to react to humans. For example, this extends 
to ideas like “curious agents” and “motivated agents” [118], which 
might support proactive problem-solving and adaptability within 
environments like “resilient hospitals” [161].

5.5 “Reactive” Retrofitted Design in Smart 
Buildings 
Our analysis around the technological interventions in smart build-
ings (subsection 4.4) shows that the majority are concentrated in the 
Space Plan and Stuff layers [28], which are inherently more flexible 
and adaptable. The current distribution of technological interven-
tions across the building layers thus reveals a reactive approach to 
interaction design in smart buildings. This late involvement raises 
questions about how interaction designers can get involved earlier 
in the process of planning and design of future buildings? Early in-
volvement of designers offers the potential to integrate interactive 
systems directly into the building’s fundamental layers, such as 
Structure and Skin, rather than retrofitting technology into more 
transient layers like Space Plan and Stuff. Designers, when included 
early, can employ iterative and participatory methods to ensure 
that the resulting smart buildings address the needs of occupants 
[4]. However, challenges remain in achieving the early involvement 
of designers. As observed by Verma et al. [168] , the building design 
process is bound by rigid schedules and defined objectives, leaving 
little room for experimentation. According to Verma et al. [168] , 
the tendency to finalise most design decisions before construction 
begins makes the integration of interaction design particularly 
challenging. Furthermore, the “siloed” nature of architecture, engi-
neering, and technology disciplines complicates cross-disciplinary 
collaboration where construction timelines and budget constraints 
often favour established workflows, creating resistance to adopting 
iterative and participatory strategies [168]. While mindful of these 
challenges, there is potential in integrating smart building technol-
ogy into the building structure from the outset, rather than being 
retrofitted into the more transient layers. 
6 Discussion of Research Gap: What Could We 
Design for When We Design Smart Buildings 
Our review identified 11 unique experiences and 20 distinct design 
mechanisms, reflecting the broad, experimental, and evolving na-
ture of smart building research. While this diversity highlights a 
field still in its formative stages, the scattered approaches indicate 
an opportunity for consolidation and theory-building to provide 
clearer guidance. In the following, we point out research areas 
that we consider particularly relevant and promising for further 
development in the domain of smart building design. 
More-Than-Human Perspectives in Smart Buildings. Our review 
did not find more-than-human perspectives in smart buildings. 
These perspectives challenge the traditional user-centred design by 
emphasising environments where human and non-human actors 
are examined collectively [51, 74, 170]. Within smart buildings, this 
could mean considering their environmental impact during human 
inhabitation as well as times of non-occupancy (e.g. during off-peak 
hours or after abandonment). A more-than-human perspective 
could guide technology to sustain relationships with non-human 
actors during these phases, by developing safety measures for lo-
cal birds that may crash into building façades [23]. Furthermore, 
smart buildings could engage with local ecosystems by adopting 
Biophilic Design patterns, such as incorporating wildlife corridors 
to allow animal movement and reconnect fragmented habitats in urban areas [179]. Empathic Design mechanisms could foster a sense 
of ecological responsibility through the integration of “animalisti-
cally behaving” robotic components to enhance connections with 
local wildlife [75]. Smart building devices could actively “nego-
tiate” climate levels in office rooms with occupants, prioritising 
environmental considerations [106]. 
Critically, more-than-human perspectives also raise ethical and 
practical questions. Who decides the “priorities” of non-human 
actors (such as the living bio-diversity in building ecosystems) in 
a building? How do we ensure that smart systems designed for 
ecological sensitivity do not inadvertently impose anthropocentric 
values onto non-human entities? These considerations highlight 
the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to integrate ecologi-
cal, ethical, and technological insights into smart building design. 
More-than-human co-design has already become a part of smart 
city discourses, considering relationships between humans and 
non-human actors including plants, animals, insects, as well as 
soil, water, and other ecological features [62, 80]. Drawing inspi-
ration from these strategies, co-design approaches could provide 
an opportunity to engage ecological stakeholders (e.g. conserva-
tionists, environmental scientists) alongside participants [80]. This 
could ensure that more-than-human perspectives are meaningfully 
integrated into the design and evaluation of smart buildings. 
Comfort as a Bodily Experience. While somaesthetic approaches 
were observed in addressing Emotional and Bodily Experiences, 
Comfort continues to be predominantly defined by traditional 
metrics such as thermal and visual conditions, overlooking the 
embodied dimensions of how we experience the built environ-
ments we inhabit. The absence of Somaesthetic Design in Comfort 
studies indicates an opportunity to rethink comfort through the 
lens of “design with the body” [85]. This could involve designing 
smart buildings that account for not just environmental parame-
ters, but also the ways in which bodily postures, movements, and 
somatic experiences contribute to a holistic well-being [ 40]. Incor-
porating somaesthetics into comfort raises questions about what it 
means to “live with our bodies” in smart buildings. This approach 
may even question the very foundations of comfort studies. For 
example, should building design create opportunities for (mild) 
discomfort—as a human natural state—to promote mindfulness 
through enhanced bodily awareness [163]? This would be in con-
trast to projects like SonicTaiChi which integrates pleasing sound 
and slow movement to promote restoration [92]. Instead, could 
we further explore smart architectural elements to intentionally 
induce acoustic discomfort to provoke the recognition of stress, 
not to alleviate stress temporarily, but to provoke awareness of 
its underlying causes, encouraging deeper self-reflection and the 
pursuit of long-term solutions? [163]. 
Social Justice and Activism. Beyond civic values, Democratic 
Experiences could be extended to include social justice themes 
such as feminism [122], racial justice [50], and activist design per-
spectives (such as anti-oppressive design [64]), that were notably 
limited. These omissions are striking, given ongoing discussions 
in HCI and technology design [44]. Feminist and activist lenses 
could be crucial for understanding how smart buildings can either 
reinforce or challenge power structures and inequalities [122]. For 
What Do We Design for When We Design “Smart Buildings”? - A Scoping Review of Human 
Experience Design Research in Buildings CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
example, a feminist lens could question how personalisation fea-
tures in smart buildings (e.g. temperature in shared office spaces) 
disproportionately impact gender relations [26]. Additionally, spa-
tial design research highlights that Sense of Orientation differs 
across genders, i.e. a tendency to rely on mental maps and cardinal 
directions, as opposed to favouring route-based navigation using 
landmarks and sequential cues [125]. A feminist perspective could 
investigate how smart building features—such as adaptive wayfind-
ing systems or customisable navigation aids—could support diverse 
cognitive strategies [48, 102]. 
Neurodiversity is another under-explored area in smart building 
design. Technologies could better accommodate sensory differences 
in individuals by incorporating features like adjustable lighting and 
soundscapes. For example, personalised smart lighting can benefit 
individuals with ADHD to retain attention and cognitive perfor-
mance [16]. Similarly, adapting the design of wayfinding systems 
can lead individuals with autism on routes that avoid spaces with 
certain disturbing environmental features (e.g. sound or odours) 
[22]. Despite growing recognition, the effective implementation of 
neurodiverse considerations in smart building technologies remains 
an open challenge [16, 31, 103]. 
In the context of cultural activism, drawn from urban studies [35], 
smart buildings could serve as platforms for creative practices aimed 
at social and political change. Interactive art installations or adap-
tive architectural features could spotlight social injustices such as 
unequal access to housing or energy resources [107]. Smart build-
ings could also act as mediums for cultural activism by creating 
spaces that foster collective storytelling, resistance, or solidarity 
among communities. Through mechanisms such as Playful Design 
or Community and Social Connections [152], smart building design 
could support activist practices like hosting protests or interactive 
public events that raise awareness of societal inequities. Applying 
these perspectives could re-direct smart building research towards 
new design horizons shaped by principles of social justice [57]. 
Evaluating the Smart Building Experience. Through this scoping 
review, we observed a limited emphasis of papers on the evalu-
ation of smart building experiences. This raises the question of 
whether new assessment frameworks, metrics, and methodologies 
are needed to be developed. Traditional metrics like objective com-
fort measurements do not fully capture the complexities of smart 
building interactions, especially as these environments become 
more immersive, interactive, and personalised. For instance, in the 
context of educational spaces, Learning and Teaching Experi-
ences highlight the potential to create smart buildings that encour-
age collaboration, exploration, and knowledge-sharing [108]. How-
ever, evaluation of these experiences often relies on conventional 
measures, such as students’ concentration [100]. This may over-
look the impact of learning spaces on more complex experiences 
such as emotion [67, 68] and playfulness [38] that are recognised 
to affect learning. Therefore, additional metrics and new methods 
of evaluation are required that can account for the subjectivity and 
complexity of human interactive experiences in built environments. 
At the same time, some of the targeted human experiences—such 
as Bodily Experiences or Aesthetic Experiences— require devel-
oping qualitative methods to evaluate technological interventions 
that are grounded in the knowledge of human psychological and physiological responses to environments (e.g. environmental psy-
chology [24]). Currently, these experiences are captured in terms 
of descriptive qualities, such as the emotional resonance of a space, 
the sensory richness of an environment, or the harmony between 
occupants and their surroundings [56, 150]. While these qualitative 
methods can provide valuable insights into the lived and embod-
ied aspects of smart buildings, the opportunity to combine them 
with physiological sensing and associated quantitative methods 
(e.g. [123]) has been largely overlooked. As a next step, future re-
search should systematically review and map existing evaluation 
methods for assessing human experiences in smart buildings to 
provide a more accurate picture of existing methods and determine 
the need for new frameworks and approaches. 
Anticipated Technological Integration in Smart Buildings. Current 
smart building technologies are primarily driven by sensors and 
actuators, with emerging technologies such as AI-enabled systems 
and extended reality yet to find a widespread practical application 
in built environments [124]. The incorporation of such technologies 
has however been discussed with caution and awareness around 
unintended consequences related to privacy, sustainability, and the 
risk of over-reliance on artificial environments at the expense of 
natural, sensory-rich experiences [124]. For example, while gen-
erative AI (genAI) offers possibilities for dynamic and adaptive 
environments, its substantial carbon footprint raises critical ques-
tions about sustainability [42]. With the building industry already 
contributing significantly to global emissions, combining these 
two areas requires careful consideration. While genAI may not 
be strictly necessary for many purposes, it is likely to be used by 
researchers and practitioners interested in experimenting with it. 
One promising avenue lies in leveraging more lightweight genAI 
models [116] for Aesthetic Experiences, which could enhance 
sensory engagement and atmosphere without having to hinge on 
data-intensive AI processes. By leveraging “scalable” environmental 
elements like light, sound, and spatial configurations [55, 90], light-
weight genAI could support the creation of dynamic and enriching 
environments with a reduced ecological footprint. Adaptive light-
ing and soundscapes powered by such models could offer evolving 
atmospheres tailored to user preferences while minimising energy 
consumption [181]. Integrating Aesthetic Experiences with XR 
and lightweight genAI models could further enable novel forms 
of creative expression in smart buildings. These systems might 
craft immersive environments “prompted” by occupants based on 
their preferences to enable aspects such as creativity over purely 
functional or utilitarian goals in smart spaces [38]. 
7 Discussion of Limitations: Researcher Lens in 
Creation of Targeted Experiences and Design 
Mechanisms 
We acknowledge that our work aligns with the third paradigm in 
HCI, making the research process interpretive and shaped by our 
individual and collective perspectives [79]. For instance, Somaes-
thetic Design and Bodily Experiences reflect the ongoing interests 
within the HCI community, while Biophilic Design might be influ-
enced by the authors’ interests in multi-sensory connections to 
nature in smart buildings. The creation of the Explorative and/or 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Rao et al. 
Future and Speculative experience also draws from our background 
in architecture research and IxD, capturing how digital technolo-
gies transform physical spaces. Therefore, we acknowledge that 
our positionality as researchers in the fields of HCI and architec-
ture influenced how we categorised and interpreted the material. 
Rather than offering definitive or universal insights, we present 
these findings as part of an ongoing discourse. 
Some papers could have been understood as focused on health 
and care-giving (e.g. [87, 156]). We did not establish a distinct ex-
perience around this concept, recognising that these aspects are 
inherently embedded within the other experiences we identified. 
For instance, many works within Emotional Experiences and 
Comfort are predominantly underpinned by health and care-giving 
considerations [5, 183]. Mechanisms like Community and Social Con-
nection and Technological Immersion also indirectly foster care by 
promoting socialisation and immersive health-related interactions. 
Researchers focused on these topics may choose to view our dataset 
through a different lens to explore care-giving more explicitly. 
Our search keywords may also have impacted our overall set of 
works. To narrow our search, we included “interac*” to focus on 
human interaction. This may have inadvertently excluded studies 
from outside the HCI community that do not explicitly mention 
interaction, yet still address human experiences in smart buildings, 
although we found no direct evidence that this was the case. Finally, 
we categorised papers based on primary and overarching experi-
ences that they targeted. Future research expanding our work to 
capture all experiences, i.e., including secondary and tangential 
ones, may uncover other targeted human experiences. Rather, this 
categorisation enabled us to elicit distinct features of the smart 
building research landscape and to conduct a deeper exploration of 
specific core experiences and accompanying design mechanisms. 
8 Concluding Remarks and Future Direction 
We were motivated to understand the key considerations and design 
goals that impact human experiences within smart buildings. To 
achieve this, we conducted a scoping review of 192 papers, adopting 
a hybrid inductive-deductive approach informed by thematic anal-
ysis coding techniques [30]. Through this process, we identified 
11 distinct human experiences, 20 design mechanisms that shape 
these experiences, and a typology of the technological interventions 
through which they are implemented. Our research sheds light on 
how current smart building designs aim to address human experi-
ences. However, this is only a partial view of the broader challenge 
[98]. While we have explored what we design for, a pressing ques-
tion remains: what should we design for? Answering this question 
demands a broader conversation involving interdisciplinary collab-
oration, policy-making, and the inclusion of diverse voices. Moving 
forward, the challenge will be to create practical opportunities for 
smart building development underpinned by a design horizon that 
prioritises both the occupants and the broader societal visions.

Visions for Future Research 
“What does it entail to be embraced by a space that responds to 
your actions?” Conceptual design and proto-
typing of a responsive space, us-
ing modern dance as a method 
to explore interaction qualities. Interactive installation The Dress Room - white cube 
that responds to the body move-
ments over the floor “What does it entail to be embraced by a space that responds to your actions?” Sensors in the floor detecting 
body movements, Pneumatic 
pistons to move the walls, Ar-
duino Mega boards for control" 
"White textile tent suspended 
within a steel frame Future architectural spaces will incorporate responsive elements to enhance 
interaction and experience 
“What kind of relations can we create between the active body 
and the active space?” “What kind of relations can we create between the active body and the active space?” DANCE AS RESEARCH 
METHOD - Observations and 
interviews “The Dress Room is a responsive space. It moves. It adapts. The floor senses where 
you are. The room responds. It follows you. It stops. It collapses then expands. You 
are enclosed. It is a dress you wear. Sometimes it fits, sometimes it misbehaves. It 
invites you to move. To explore. To dance. The Dress Room blurs the boundaries 
between architecture and clothes.” 
“What qualities does the responsivity have for creating certain 
experiences of a space?” “What qualities does the responsivity have for creating certain experiences of a space?” “Thus, with the Dress Room as a simple responsive space explored through modern 
dance I have begun to outline some of the experiential qualities of being embraced 
by a space that responds to our bodily motions. My explorations have indicated 
that responsive spaces hold the potential to make us form a kind of symbiosis 
with the space they are in – that the temporal form of the space’s responsivity 
enables us to design for a sense of intimacy. They further indicated that our actions 
and the space’s responses become interchanged and while the body and the room 
moves together they are constantly motivated/actuated by one another. The mutual 
responses of the body and the space are integrated but not the same. They are in a 
cause-and-effect relationship that is constantly evolving.” 
“Through the Dress Room, I begin to explore the qualities of re-
sponsive spaces and embodied interaction.” “. This seems to indicate that exposing our body to an unfamiliar responsive environment may be 
a bit daunting at first it may be something we need to overcome.” 
“Indeed, what I am interested in with this study is to explore 
the kind of relations we can create between the active body and 
the active space. I see explorations like this as a step towards 
understanding what experiences and new types of interaction 
these responsive spaces can foster” “The Dress Room’s ability to motivate Nana to move towards certain areas of the space as well as 
to move her body in specific ways indicate that responsive spaces can have a significant qualities 
when it comes to motion motivation.” 
“What I want to explore here is the experience of the responsivity 
from a fully embodied interaction perspective. What experiential 
qualities does it have? What possibly new ways of inhabiting 
space it can encourage? What potential new types of interaction 
can we develop from this?” “Thus, with the Dress Room as a simple responsive space explored through modern dance I have 
begun to outline some of the experiential qualities of being embraced by a space that responds 
to our bodily motions. My explorations have indicated that responsive spaces hold the potential 
to make us form a kind of symbiosis with the space they are in – that the temporal form of the 
space’s responsivity enables us to design for a sense of intimacy. They further indicated that our 
actions and the space’s responses become interchanged and while the body and the room moves 
together they are constantly motivated/actuated by one another. The mutual responses of the body 
and the space are integrated but not the same. They are in a cause-and-effect relationship that is 
constantly evolving.” 
“The Dress Room is a white cube that responds to the body’s movements over the floor. The walls 
move, the room collapses or expands.” 
“The outcome suggests that interacting with responsive environments can help create a sense of 
intimacy as well as motivate our motions within the space.” 
“The Dress Room is a white cube that responds to the body movements over the floor. It is made from 
a white square textile tent suspended within a steel frame measuring 5x5x5 meter. The suspension 
allows for the entire room to move more than half a meter in each direction. The sensors in the 
floor detect where a body is and the room responds either by moving with or away from that body 
depending on the setup.” 
“Through a dancer’s experiences we begin to understand what experiential qualities, and thus 
what possibilities for interaction design, this kind of responsiveness affords.” 
“The Dress Room was developed as an aesthetic exploration and is deliberately abstract in its 
expression. It has no function other than as a responsive enclosure.” 
“The Dress Room is an abstract installation made in an attempt to focus the experience around the 
responsivity. It is conceived as a space you take on like a dress.” 
“the Dress Room is about letting the white garment create a space in co-production with the 
movements of the body.” 
“First Type Responsive Form: The Room as a Dress We started out letting the room respond as a 
dress in the sense that the walls would follow the body within. The room follows you around. It 
makes you feel that you wear a room. You feel in Control. You belong together. You cannot escape – 
the door keeps evading you.” 
“Second Type of Responsive Form: The Vertical Response The second type of responsive form was 
designed to explore the vertical dimensions of the room. We had deliberately created the room with 
a high ceiling allowing us to collapse it without coming in contact with the person within” 
“Still, what does it mean to inhabit an abstract space like the Dress Room? It is abstract like art 
yet it demands more than an onlooker to be understood. It demands active participation. Thus, I 
have chosen a method that meets this space at its level of abstraction while still enabling active 
bodily engagement. I have chosen to use modern dance performed by a professional dancer whose 
experiences I have sought to understand through observations and interviews.” 
“Overall Nana described the Dress Room as a constant source of inspiration. She explained that 
even when she repeated a series of movements within the same responsive form and the response 
from the pistons was the same the fabric would ripple differently each time creating an overall 
unique expression.” 
“She explained that after a while she ceased to focus on how her actions influenced specific responses, 
and instead she eased into a dance where her motions became responses as well as actuators.” 
“Lastly, Nana explained while demonstrating through body language how certain responses in the 
Dress Room would inspire her to do certain movements.” 
“The two experiential qualities that Nana experienced in the responsive room can be articulated as 
intimacy and motivated motion.” “With the Dress Room, I sat out to explore embodied interaction with responsive spaces.” 
“Thus, with the Dress Room as a simple responsive space explored through modern dance I have 
begun to outline some of the experiential qualities of being embraced by a space that responds 
to our bodily motions. My explorations have indicated that responsive spaces hold the potential 
to make us form a kind of symbiosis with the space they are in – that the temporal form of the 
space’s responsivity enables us to design for a sense of intimacy. They further indicated that our 
actions and the space’s responses become interchanged and while the body and the room moves 
together they are constantly motivated/actuated by one another. The mutual responses of the body 
and the space are integrated but not the same. They are in a cause-and-effect relationship that is 
constantly evolving.”

Table 5: A typology of technological interventions in smart buildings. We provide a name and explanation for each technological 
intervention. Additionally, we share the number of papers that employed the intervention in their work, along with a few 
prototypical examples. Finally, we demonstrate the connection between the interventions and the targeted human experiences 
by listing the top three most frequently appearing experiences for which the intervention was employed. 
Type of Intervention Description N Prototypical Examples Associated Targeted Experiences 
(n=3) 
Audio and Lighting Sound and light as key design materials, often synchronised to evoke 
emotional responses, guide behaviour, or modify spatial perception, 
creating multi-sensory and immersive environments. 27 Mediated Atmospheres is a modular workspace 
using lighting, video projection, and sound to 
transform the appearance of the workspace, 
tested with 33 participants to collect subjective 
and objective measures [142]. Trivet Fields uses 
mini-speakers to create soundscapes to aestheti-
cally delineate space [93]. Aesthetic Experiences (n=8), Emo-
tional Experiences (n=7), Comfort 
(n=6) 
Augmented and Virtual Re-
ality Provided immersive experiences blending physical and digital spaces, 
enhancing spatial awareness and interaction in novel ways. 17 Weightless Walls uses user positions and noise-
cancelling headphones to display virtual walls to 
create auditory privacy in office environments 
[159]. An immersive and interactive methodol-
ogy using physiological indicators is developed 
to assess comfort and performance in work of-
fices [148]. VR Living Rooms use virtual reality 
simulations of indoor environments to measure 
psychological responses and affective states [160]. Explorative and/or Future and 
Speculative (n=6), Sense of Place-
making (n=4), Emotional Experi-
ences (n=4) 
Environmental Sensing Utilises IoT-connected sensors to monitor environmental conditions-
temperature, light, air quality, and noise, either adjusting parameters 
automatically or providing real-time information to enhance interac-
tion with space. 23 Environmental sensors were deployed to measure 
temperature, humidity, and light, with data visu-
alised for occupants and building managers [46]. 
Hilo-box uses CO2 sensors and machine learning 
to forecast indoor air quality during office meet-
ings [184]. Comfort (n=13), Democratic Experi-
ences (n=5), Explorative and/or Fu-
ture and Speculative (n=4) 
Feedback Systems Included participatory sensing mobile apps that empowered users 
to design and adjust their environments through data collection and 
feedback, fostering personalisation and responsiveness. Also giving 
users cues around the building to ease tasks like navigation. 11 Follow-the-Lights uses ambient lighting, pres-
sure mats, and abstract visualisations to influence 
stair and elevator usage through behavioural cues 
[144]. A building Twitter bot for engaging with 
building occupants around their preferences and 
experiences [120]. Emotional Experiences (n=2), 
Democratic Experiences (n=2), 
Inclusion Experiences (n=2) 
Interactive Displays Integrated with RGB and depth cameras, motion tracking, and 3D 
simulations, these displays adapt to user interactions, creating dynamic 
and responsive environments in both residential and public spaces. 45 Interactive window display uses large screens, 
RGB and depth cameras, and temperature sen-
sors to display context-related scenery [171]. 
WaveWindow uses projectors, microphones, and 
cameras for users to interact with digital content 
on an interactive retail window display [134]. Explorative and/or Future and Spec-
ulative (n=14), Experience of Relat-
edness (n=13), Emotional Experi-
ences (n=9) 
Physiological Sensing Used biofeedback devices and wearables to monitor bodily responses, 
with some interventions adapting environmental conditions in real-
time based on physiological data. 10 Data such as Electroencephalography (EEG), 
heart rate, skin conductance, and pulse volume 
measurements were used to understand neuro-
physiological responses towards smart home sys-
tems [11]. Comfort (n=6), Emotional Experi-
ences (n=4), Inclusion Experiences 
(n=2) 
Shape-Changing and Ki-
netic Interfaces Introduced dynamic physical changes in environments through adap-
tive furniture and walls that respond to user presence and activities, 
enabling real-time adaptation of spaces. 22 TidalSpace is a design concept that creates an 
interactive spatial boundary for work-from-home 
parents [89]. The Shape-changing work desk uses 
digital tabletops and motion tracking to enable 
proxemic transitions in informal meetings [76]. Bodily Experiences (n=9), Explo-
rative and/or Future and Specula-
tive (n=7), Sense of Place-making
