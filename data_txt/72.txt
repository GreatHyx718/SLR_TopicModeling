ABSTRACT
This article explores the representation of the female image in the 
visual artwork of generative AI and the gender issues in it, using 
eight different generative AI systems, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, Shuhua, and 
Yihui from China and Nightcafe, Fotor, Jasper Art, DALLE and Deep 
dream generator from the West, as comparative cases. In this paper, 
female cyborg is selected as a representative of female images, 
using the theoretical framework of posthumanism. This paper first 
provides research background about generative AI and cyborg. By 
inputting the same text in these eight generative AI systems, this 
paper obtains 107 images in different scenarios of basic images, 
home, work, and fighting. By comparing and analysing these 
images horizontally and vertically, this paper explores how 
Chinese and Western generative AI systems perceive female 
cyborg. In conclusion, by choosing female cyborg as 
a representation of the female figure, this paper explores how 
generative AI imagines the future of humanity and how this imagi -
nation echoes with the human imagination in a paradoxical way.ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction
In today’s era of rapid advancements in artificial intelligence technology, the complex 
interplay between generative AI and human creativity and imagination has increasingly 
become a hot topic in academic discourse. Current research primarily focuses on how 
generative AI can enhance human imagination and creativity in fields like writing and 
education (Anil R Doshi and Oliver Hauser 2023 ; Punya Mishra and Danah Henriksen  
2024 ), and debates whether AI itself possesses the capability to create art from 
a philosophy of technology perspective (Mark Coeckelbergh 2016 ; Galit Wellner 2021 ). 
This paper takes these discussions further by exploring the intriguing representations of 
female cyborgs generated by AI from diverse cultural backgrounds, examining how these 
digital constructs paradoxically resonate with human visions of the future.
The core of this research lies in its exploration of how female cyborgs are imagined and 
portrayed across academia, popular culture, and generative AI. By comparing 107 images

in four scenarios generated by eight different AI systems (including ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, 
Shuhua, and Yihui from China, and Nightcafe, Fotor, Jasper Art, Deep Dream Generator, 
and DALL-E from the West), this paper employs both horizontal and vertical comparative 
methods to reveal how generative AI reflects, enhances, and sometimes paradoxically 
echoes the human imagination. These AI-generated images do not merely display tech -
nological sophistication; they also map and reinforce existing gender and cultural biases, 
making this analysis a critical window into the interactions among technology, gender, 
and culture.
Posthumanism provides the theoretical framework for this study. Within posthumanist 
discourse, the concept of the cyborg holds significant and representative value. As 
hybrids that blur the boundaries between humans and machines, as well as nature and 
technology, the cyborg challenges traditional anthropocentric views (Donna J Haraway  
1991 ; Dilek Tüfekci Can 2023 ). Through the metaphor of the cyborg, posthumanism not 
only explores the relationship between technology and identity but also critiques the 
power structures and oppressive mechanisms inherent in western modernity (Elaine 
Graham 2001 ). The portrayal of female cyborgs not only displays technological innovation 
but also predicts and reflects on the potential directions of future human societies, 
making the female cyborg a potent symbol for examining generative AI in the context 
of future feminism.
This research stands out for its cross-cultural perspective and methodology. By com -
paring images of female cyborgs generated by AI systems from China and the West, this 
paper reveals how cultures shape technological expressions of gender and how these 
expressions, in turn, influence our cultural perceptions and gender constructs. This cross- 
cultural comparison, largely unexplored in existing literature, not only broadens our 
understanding of how AI impacts gender and cultural perceptions globally but also offers 
innovative theoretical and practical perspectives for feminist media studies. Through this 
study, we better understand how technology replicates, challenges, and redefines gender 
and cultural boundaries on a global scale, providing theoretical and practical insights for 
technological innovations aimed at promoting gender equality and social justice.
Generative AI and female cyborg
Generative AI
Generative AI, as defined by Tat Putjorn and Pruet Putjorn (2023 ), refers to artificial 
intelligence systems capable of producing text or images based on user input. This 
technology has been shown to significantly enhance the creativity and imagination of 
adolescents, emphasising its potential value in education. However, the use of generative 
AI also comes with a range of challenges, such as algorithmic bias, authorship and ethical 
issues, and legal concerns regarding ownership and attribution (Ruth West and Andres 
Burbano 2020 ).
Particularly concerning gender representation, generative AI has demonstrated 
a tendency to reinforce workplace gender stereotypes. Various studies and reports 
have highlighted issues of gender bias, stereotypes, and underrepresentation in AI- 
generated images. Research by Francisco-José García-Ull and Mónica Melero-Lázaro 
(2023 ) noted that when DALL-E was used to generate images of various professions, it 2
 Y. V. LI
not only replicated existing gender biases but also intensified them, affecting both 
males and females. Luhang Sun, Mian Wei, Yibing Sun, Yoo Ji Suh, Liwei Shen, and Sijia 
Yang (2023 ) revealed a significant lack of female representation in male-dominated 
industries through their comparison of gender representation in AI-generated profes -
sional images. Anna M Gorska and Dariusz Jemielniak (2023 ) conducted a comparative 
study of images of four professions generated by nine popular systems, further 
confirming gender bias in the portrayal of professionals, with an overemphasis on 
male images in certain fields.
These findings highlight the importance of studying images generated by generative 
AI to understand the interplay between technology and gender issues. Through these 
images, we can observe how existing gender biases in cultural and societal structures are 
replicated and amplified by technology. However, these studies lack exploration of 
generative AI’s imagination of human futures, particularly how different cultural AI 
systems depict this imagination.
Cyborg
Cyborg, a synthesis of “Cybernetics” and “Organism,” was first introduced by Manfred 
E Clynes and Nathan S Kline (1960 ) in their work Cyborgs and Space. They proposed the 
concept as a way to modify the human body to adapt to space environment through 
technological enhancements. It represents an integration of the human body with 
machinery, designed to extend human capacities to withstand extreme conditions. This 
original definition was intended to explore how technology could expand the biological 
limitations of humans.
Haraway (1991 ) expanded on this concept in her Cyborg Manifesto, where she intro -
duced the famous Cyborg metaphor. Haraway envisioned the cyborg as a form of being 
transcending biological and mechanical, natural and artificial, gender and species bound -
aries, offering an identity perspective that surpasses binary gender constructs. In her 
perspective, the cyborg serves as the ideal vector for the postmodernist critique of 
patriarchy and capitalism, possessing fluid and mutable identities that capable of trans -
gressing inherent social and cultural boundaries.
In popular culture, cyborg is often depicted as characters with superhuman abilities 
and mechanical body parts. For example, in films like Blade Runner (1982 ) and Ghost in 
the Shell (1995 ), cyborg characters contribute significant dramatic tension to the narra -
tive. In games like Detroit : Become Human (2018 ), cyborg characters are even endowed 
with emotional and moral decision-making capacities. These representations of cyborg in 
pop culture not only demonstrate an exploration of self-awareness but also reflect 
concerns about overreliance on technology. Zenab Jehangir (2022 ) examines how anti- 
utopian science fiction in the United States stigmatises AI. It has also been noted that 
these works explore themes of free will, consciousness and human rights through the lens 
of cyborg (Dani Cavallaro 2000 ), emphasizing the complexity of technology-human 
integration and its potential impacts on individual freedom and societal structures 
(Chris Hables Gray 2000; Sherry Turkle 1995 ).
The presence of cyborg in popular culture coincides with the critique of tradi -
tional anthropocentrism in posthumanism. From a posthumanist perspective, 
cyborg is not just a merger of technology and biology but also a symbol of new FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
 3
social relations and cultural practices. It challenges the conventional constructs of 
gender, race, and category, providing a tool for rethinking modernity and evolu -
tion (Rosi Braidotti 2013 ).
However, the duality of the cyborg cannot be overlooked. While it can serve as 
a marginal existence offering a new mode of resistance against patriarchy and capitalism 
prevalent in Western cultures, it could also be employed to reinforce existing power 
structures. In some contexts, cyborg might even be seen as a threat to individual 
autonomy, becoming a mere tool or part of a broader societal control mechanism 
(Judith Halberstam 2001 ; Haraway 1991 ).
Choosing female cyborg as research subject aims to explore the interactions and 
potential contradictions between the cyborg imagery generated by AI technology 
and the cyborg imagination of humans. This research focuses on how AI either 
replicates or reinterprets the concept of cyborg, particularly in expressing gender 
identities. By using cyborgs as a lens to study AI and gender interactions, this study 
seeks to reveal whether AI can offer a kind of imagination of humanity that is 
consistent with a feminist perspective of future. This not only helps us understand 
how technology plays a role in shaping our perceptions of gender and identity but 
also challenges our existing notions of the interplay between gender, technology, 
and creativity.
Methodology
Case selection
To explore how AI reinterprets the concept of cyborg, particularly in terms of gender 
identity, this study selected eight representative generative AI systems: ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, 
Shuhua, and Yihui from China, and Nightcafe, Fotor, Jasper Art, Deep Dream Generator, 
and DALL-E from Western countries. The choice of these systems was based on the 
following criteria:
(1)Technological Advancement: The selected AI systems are at the technological 
forefront in their respective fields. For example, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0 is currently the 
largest AI model in terms of global parameters, significantly surpassing the latest 
models in image-text alignment (Gloria Levine 2022 ). The Deep Dream Generator is 
renowned for creating surrealistic and dreamlike artworks.1
(2)Widespread Use and Recognition: These systems are extensively used in the fields 
of art and design, ensuring the practicality and relevance of the research. For 
instance, DALL-E, Jasper Art, and Nightcafe have been cited in several articles as 
the best image-generating AI systems.2
(3)Accessibility and Replicability: These generative AI systems are easily accessible and 
typically offer some level of free trial, ensuring that the research results have a high 
degree of generalizability and replicability.
(4)Cultural Diversity: Systems from diverse cultural backgrounds were selected to 
explore and compare how AI from different cultural perspectives imagines the 
future of humanity, emphasizing a cross-cultural research viewpoint.4

Image generation
This research utilizes a specific design to analyze how AI presents images of female cyborg 
in various cultural contexts. According to existing studies, images, as a form of text, can 
offer rich information about gender, culture, and technology (Gillian Rose 2016 ). To 
ensure the accuracy and systematicity of the study, the image generation process fol-
lowed a strict operational protocol. The theme of “female cyborgs” was chosen and 
images were generated around four different social scenarios: a base image, 
a household scenario, a workplace scenario, and a fighting scenario. These scenarios 
were selected based on the symbolic significance of cyborg as the intersection of 
technology and gender.
In order to comprehensively explore the representation of female cyborgs across 
different cultural and social contexts, each selected AI system generated between two 
to six images for each scenario based on given textual prompts. Specifically, the selection 
of images was based on the free quotas provided by each AI system; the number and type 
of images generated were directly dependent on the free services available without 
financial burden. This selection method meant that the images used were naturally 
generated by the AI systems without any pre-set filtering criteria, ensuring the authenti -
city and randomness of the research and avoiding potential biases from over-filtering.
During the image generation process, I did not select images from the AI output; 
instead, I used the results naturally generated by the AI systems based on the textual 
prompts. This approach was intended to minimize the impact of human selection on the 
research outcomes, allowing the results to more accurately reflect how different AI 
systems handle the theme of female cyborgs. In this manner, a total of 107 images 
were collected for analysis.
The textual prompts for each scenario were designed to guide the AI systems in 
creatively interpreting the role of the “female cyborg” in specific social contexts. These 
prompts were both specific and open-ended, delineating the themes to be explored while 
being broad enough to allow the AI to exhibit its creativity and diversity of interpretation 
across different social roles. This method not only ensured the diversity and comprehen -
siveness of the collected image data but also reduced potential biases in the research 
design by avoiding overly specific operational directions, providing a rich visual material 
for subsequent qualitative analysis.
Specific textual prompts included:
(1)Basic image: The textual prompt is “female cyborg,” which aims to capture the 
fundamental visual characteristics and imagery of female cyborg.
(2)Home scenario: The textual prompt is “A female cyborg is doing something at 
home, reflecting the role she plays at home,” which showcases the daily activities 
and role portrayal of female cyborg in a domestic environment.
(3)Workplace scenario: The textual prompt is “A female cyborg is working, reflecting 
the role she plays in the workplace,” which explores the functions and responsi -
bilities of female cyborg in a professional environment.
(4)Fighting scenario: The textual prompt is “A female cyborg is fighting, reflecting the 
role she plays in the fighting,” which depicts the performance and capabilities of 
female cyborg in combat or conflict situations.FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES

This method of textual prompting, inspired by previous research, has proven highly 
effective in guiding AI technology to generate images of research value (Yaru Hao, 
Zewen Chi, Li Dong and Furu Wei 2024 ; Jonas Oppenlaender 2023 ). Through this 
approach, we were able to ensure that the collected images broadly covered 
different cultural interpretations and social contexts, offering valuable perspectives 
and data for exploring how generative AI addresses the intersection of gender and 
technology.
Analysis method
The qualitative analysis method used in this study was designed to provide insights into 
the images of female cyborg produced by different generative AI systems, and how these 
images reflect and reinterpret the concept of female cyborg. This approach design 
references visual semiotics, which provides a theoretical basis for investigating how still 
images generate meaning, symbolising images that can be interpreted, conveying infor -
mation, ideas, and values, etc (Claire Harrison 2003 ; Gunther R Kress and Theo Van 
Leeuwen 2006 ; Sandra Moriarty 2004 ). The analysis was conducted in two main stages, 
each utilizing a separate set of coding but following the same underlying process to 
systematically capture and interpret the subtle nuances and cultural meanings embedded 
in AI-generated images.
In the first coding pass, emphasis was placed on reviewing each image to identify and 
interpret essential visual elements and prominent themes that consistently emerged. This 
preliminary phase allowed for an assessment of the initial codes’ relevance and compre -
hensiveness, with adjustments made as needed to ensure that the coding scheme 
effectively captured the key themes and elements. A second, more comprehensive coding 
pass was then conducted with a focus on deeper cross-cultural analysis, applying the 
refined coding tree to ensure all images were systematically analyzed with a consistent set 
of codes.
First stage of coding
In the first phase of the qualitative analysis, the images generated by each AI system were 
scrutinized to identify how consistently each system depicted the female cyborg across 
various scenarios. This analysis focused on several symbolic elements critical for under -
standing the portrayal of female cyborgs. First, for technological elements, codes such as 
“integrated technology” and “minimal technology” were used to categorize the extent of 
technological depiction in each image. Second, racial representation involved coding the 
images with tags like “predominantly white,” “diverse racial features,” and “ambiguous 
racial features” to reflect the racial characteristics displayed. Additionally, sexuality expres -
sion was coded with “sexualized,” “neutral,” and “non-sexualized” labels to analyze the 
degree of sexuality portrayed in the images. Finally, aesthetic choices included categories 
such as “futuristic,” “contemporary,” and “traditional,” capturing the aesthetic styles 
represented in each image.
The coding also varied by scenario. For instance, in the home scenario, codes such as 
“domestic activities,” “passive presence,” and “active engagement” were used to describe 
the cyborg’s role within a domestic setting. In the workplace scenario, codes like “profes -
sional setting,” “labor-intensive,” and “leadership roles” described the activities and 6

environment depicted. In the combat scenario, codes such as “aggressive posture,” 
“defensive actions,” and “neutral stance” depicted the cyborg’s involvement in combat- 
related contexts.
To further illustrate these findings, Figure 1 and Figure 2 visualize the frequency 
of racial representation and sexuality expression codes in the images, providing

a clear, quantitative view of how often these characteristics appear across different 
AI systems.
Second stage of coding
In the second stage of the analysis, the focus shifts to a comprehensive cross- 
cultural comparison, critically examining how different cultural backgrounds influ -
ence AI’s imagination and portrayal of female cyborgs. First, cultural symbols were 
identified using codes like “western cultural symbols,” “eastern cultural symbols,” 
and “global/universal symbols” to capture specific cultural elements depicted in the 
images. Second, gender norms and cultural contexts were analyzed to determine 
how gender representations either align with or challenge the norms typical of the 
AI’s cultural origin, with codes such as “conformity to cultural gender norms,” 
“rebellion against cultural gender norms,” and “neutral to cultural gender norms.” 
Lastly, stylistic elements reflecting culture were coded with categories like “stylistic 
elements from western cultures,” “stylistic elements from eastern cultures,” and 
“fusion of styles” to describe the aesthetic style and its relationship to cultural 
identity.
From the detailed cross-cultural coding, several key themes were derived, providing 
a structured understanding of how different cultural influences mold AI’s creative 
processes, including cultural influence on technological integration, representation of 
global vs. local narratives, and diversity in gender representation across cultures. The 
themes developed here will facilitate a nuanced discussion on the global discourse of 
gender and technology, emphasizing the role of cultural context in shaping techno -
logical outputs.
Image analysis
Basic images
In the analysis of the basic images by eight different generative AI systems, each image 
displays visual representations of human-machine integration, embodying a wealth of 
high-tech elements, and also emphasising the integration of the machine and the human 
body (see example Figure 3). This fusion is emblematic of the posthumanist vision, which 
perceives the cyborg as a metaphor for the breakdown of clear distinctions between 
humans and machines, echoing humanity’s longstanding imagination of future techno -
logically integrated beings in science fiction literature and films (M. Keith Booker 2006 ; 
Stephen Cave, Kanta Dihal and Sarah Dillon 2020 ).
However, despite the powerful expressiveness of the technology, the images gen -
erated by AI exposes cultural biases and stereotypes in their portrayals of race and 
gender—a finding consistent with previous research (Marc Cheong et al. 2024 ; James 
Zou and Londa Schiebinger 2018 ). In terms of racial representation, most AI-generated 
images tend to depict white women, contradicting the reality of global cultural 
diversity. Only the images generated by ERNIE-ViLG 2.0 showcase Asian faces (as 
Figure 4), while some images from DALL-E and Shuhua completely erase human 
elements, thereby blurring racial features.8
 Y. V. LI
Additionally, all AI-generated images overemphasise the curves of the female body in 
the representation of female sexuality, with the position of female breasts being clearly 
highlighted. This reflects the persistence of gender stereotypes, contrasting with the 
gender boundary-blurring advocated by cyborg theory. In terms of aesthetic

representation, the majority of images pursue mainstream aesthetics, except for Shuhua, 
where in the images generated the body lines are not very obvious and the faces are 
masked (as Figure 5). These underrepresentations and discrimination are one of the 
manifestations of structural injustice (Ting-An Lin and Po-Hsuan Cameron Chen 2022 ). 
This may result from the limitations of the training dataset or the cultural biases inad -
vertently incorporated by the developers, reflecting the tensions between technology 
and socio-cultural dynamics (Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru 2018 ).
Female cyborg in home, work, and fighting
In the examination of the second scenario, generative AI systems envision female cyborgs 
performing roles within a domestic environment, revealing a nuanced interplay between 
technology and traditional gender roles, a central theme in posthumanist discourse. First, 
the setting of these scenes is generally depicted as leisurely and relaxed, typical of 
everyday home life and notably absent of overt futuristic or high-tech elements. This 
portrayal suggests that AI, in some instances, reinforces traditional female roles, prioritiz -
ing domesticity over technological enhancement. However, contrasting images from 
Yihui and DALL-E (as Figure 6), which incorporate abundant high-tech elements, indicate 
a departure from this trend, suggesting alternative visions of domestic life that integrate 
advanced technology seamlessly with daily activities.
The portrayal of characters in these scenarios further underscores the tensions 
between traditional gender norms and posthuman possibilities. The vast majority of the 
images present white women with clear sexual characteristics, with only Yihui generating 
an image of a Black woman (as Figure 7), highlighting a clear deficiency in racial diversity 
among AI-generated images. Compared to the base image scenes, the female faces in 
Figure 5. Female cyborg generated by Shuhua.10
 Y. V. LI
these domestic environments are more generic, with half of the images no longer having 
obvious mechanical or futuristic elements, showing a reliance on traditional female roles.
Activitywise, the diversity in behaviors of female cyborgs in these images ranges from 
using computers and doing yoga with VR devices to operating robotic arms (see example 
Figure 8).. This range of behaviors not only showcases technological adaptability but also 
reflects the posthumanist vision of a future where the boundaries between human and 
machine blur, allowing for a fluidity of identity that transcends fixed roles. These images 
depict a mode of existence where cyborg technology seamlessly integrates into daily life, 
fostering new and hybrid forms of being that challenge traditional distinctions between 
human and machine.

Figure 7. Female cyborg generated by Yihui.FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
 11
Conversely, the other half of the images take a more conventional approach. For 
instance, scenes from ERNIE-ViLG 2.0 showing women conversing with musical instruments, 
or DALL-E-generated images of female robots cooking, underscore a reliance on traditional 
female roles that sharply contrasts with the high-tech appearance of the cyborg figure. 
Additionally, some images, such as those generated by Nightcafe (as Figure 9), feature 
Figure 8. Female cyborg generated by Jasper Art.
Figure 9. Female cyborg generated by Nightcafe.12
 Y. V. LI
sexually suggestive poses and mechanical high heels, underscoring an ongoing sexualiza -
tion of the female body even within cyborg forms. These portrayals highlight a persistent 
attachment to traditional gender stereotypes, reinforcing fixed identities even as they hint 
at the transformative potential of technology. This juxtaposition of technological advance -
ment and traditional roles creates a visually striking tension, exposing how the cyborg 
image remains constrained by existing gender power structures.
In analysing the third scenario in which the female cyborg is represented in work 
scenes, the eight AI systems provide a consistent visual narrative: female cyborg using 
computers in office settings. The homogeneity of the scene reflects a common AI 
imagination of the modern professional environment. Notably, nearly half the images, 
particularly from Shuhua, Jasper Art, and ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, lacked futuristic technology 
elements (see example Figure 10).
While most images portray white women, the presence of Asian women in images 
from Jasper Art and Shuhua provided some racial diversity (see example Figure 11).. This 
limited diversity at least shows an attempt to break away from conventional Western- 
centric visual narratives. However, there is less emphasis on the sexualisation of females in 
most of the images, and facial features are more mass-marketed, which may reflect 
a workplace representation that tends to be generalised and depersonalised. 
Meanwhile, Nightcafe maintains its consistent representation of sexualised women and 
stereotypes, which contrasts with other AI trends, demonstrating the persistence of 
gender and cultural bias in AI-generated imagery.
Analysis of the fourth scenario revealed how AI processes the imagination of female 
cyborg in extreme conflict situations. When exploring the representation of female 
cyborg in fighting scenarios, the eight generative AI scenario settings were generally 
characterised by high-tech weaponry and futuristic features (see example Figure 12). This 
Figure 10. Female cyborg generated by Shuhua.FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
 13
design showcases the consistency in creating fighting environments and reflects common 
human imaginations of future battle scenes where technology and weaponization are 
central. This representation echoes similar themes in science fiction literature and films.
In terms of the characters, while most of the images still tend to show white women, 
several of the Asian female images generated by Jasper Art provide a degree of racial 
Figure 11. Female cyborg generated by Jasper Art.
Figure 12. Female cyborg generated by DALL-E.14
 Y. V. LI
diversity. These images of female cyborg display significant subjectivity and aggressive -
ness, and except for Nightcafe do not overemphasise or exaggerate female sexual 
characteristics, which contrasts with the traditional portrayal of women as usually passive 
and protective. Additionally, the queer representations that appear in the ERNIE-ViLG 2.0- 
generated images (as Figure 13), including gender-neutral faces and short hair, challenge 
traditional notions of gender binary, demonstrating the diversity and fluidity of gender 
representations, echoing the posthumanist definition of cyborgs as boundary-transgres -
sing entities that disrupt conventional identities..
Regarding action, most of these AI-generated female cyborgs adopt a combative or 
attacking posture, demonstrating their agency and power in fighting scenarios (see 
example Figure 14). This portrayal challenges traditional gendered expectations sur-
rounding physicality and aggression, resonating with depictions of female cyborgs in 
Figure 13. Female cyborg generated by ERNIE-ViLG 2.0.
Figure 14. Female cyborg generated by deep dream generator.FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
 15
science fiction films and novels such as Alita: Battle Angel, where female cyborgs use 
technological enhancements to empower their bodies for combat. Here, the female 
cyborg directly confronts existing power structures, leveraging her augmented strength 
as a form of resistance against conventional limitations imposed on female bodies.
In comprehensively analyzing the generative AI imagery of female cyborgs across three 
scenarios, it is evident that AI and human imaginations interact in complex ways, often 
revealing a blend of commonalities and contradictions that reflect deeply ingrained 
cultural norms. In the domestic and workplace scenarios, the portrayal of female cyborgs 
frequently adheres to traditional female roles, with many images emphasizing conven -
tional activities such as cooking and caregiving. Despite these normative portrayals, some 
AI systems like Yihui and DALL-E introduce futuristic elements that challenge these 
traditional boundaries, suggesting a potential shift in how female roles are 
conceptualized.
This emphasis on traditional roles can be critically analyzed through the lens of Judith 
Butler’s theory of gender performativity. According to Judith Butler (2002 ), gender is not 
an inherent identity but is continually constructed through repetitive performances, 
which can be rigidly encoded within AI algorithms, perpetuating traditional gender 
stereotypes. However, posthumanism, with its focus on breaking down the binary dis-
tinctions between human and machine, nature and culture, offers a transformative per-
spective on these portrayals. It suggests that the integration of technology into human 
identities—represented through cyborg imagery—could potentially subvert these nor-
mative performances by offering new ways to envision gender and identity.
Moreover, the sexualization of female cyborgs, as prominently featured in images from 
Nightcafe (see example Figure 15), reflects a troubling continuation of seeing female 
bodies as objects of desire within digital and technological spaces. This practice echoes 
Figure 15. Female cyborg generated by Nightcafe.16
 Y. V. LI
broader societal trends where female robots are often commodified and sexualized, as 
discussed by previous research (Tessa Leach 2017 ; Viviane Morrigan 2023 ; Bettina 
Vitzthum 2020 ). However, posthumanist theory encourages a reevaluation of these 
depictions, proposing that AI could play a crucial role in challenging and reshaping 
traditional gender norms and sexual politics.
Despite these issues, some AI-generated images show attempts to deconstruct and 
reshape traditional female roles and gender binaries. For example, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0 shows 
a representation of queer with androgynous faces and short hair. This portrayal aligns with 
the cyborg metaphor in posthumanism and resonates with academic studies on queer and 
AI. While some research indicates that AI often reinforces stereotypes and negatively impacts 
the visibility of the queer and LGBTQ+ communities (Karin Danielsson, Andrea Aler Tubella, 
Evelina Liliequist and Coppélie Cocq 2023 ; Michael Klipphahn-Karge, Ann-Kathrin Koster and 
Sara Morais Dos Santos Bruss 2023 ), some scholars (Guillaume Chevillon 2024 ; Joe Parslow  
2023 ; Grace Turtle 2022 ) have highlighted AI’s potential to redefine norms and explore queer 
expressions as well as fluidity in gender within algorithms, robotics, and the arts.
Cross-cultural comparison
When comparing eight generative AI systems from different cultural backgrounds, it is 
found that there are significant differences in gender expression between Chinese and 
Western AI systems. These differences reflect the imagination about sex and gender in 
different cultural contexts. In images of female cyborg generated by Chinese AI systems, the 
expression of sexual characteristics is typically less pronounced (see example Figure 16). 
Facial and body features tend to be more androgynous, with occasional queer elements. 
This mirrors the more implicit expression and imagination of sexuality in traditional Chinese

 17
culture, where public discussions about sex are considered inappropriate or immoral (Susan 
L Mann 2011 ). Additionally, China’s rigorous internet censorship limits public expression of 
sexual content, also influencing how AI represents sexual features in generated images (Earl 
Jackson 2012 ; Elaine Jeffreys 2015 ).
In contrast, Western AI systems more frequently highlight and exaggerate traditional female 
sexual traits, such as pronounced breasts and faces that align with Western mainstream beauty 
standards, and some images even contain strong sexual suggestion. In the West, expressions of 
sex are more openly accepted and visible. However, this openness can sometimes transform into 
an over-sexualization of women, particularly in media (L. Monique Ward 2016 ). Van Esch, Ally 
Geisler Patrick, Lizabeth Kleintop, Gavin Northey and Jonas Heller (2017 ) examined the sexualiza -
tion and objectification of women in LGBTQ+ advertisements, while Ana Rayén Condeza 
Dall’orso, Pablo Matus Lobos and Enrique Vergara Leighton’s (2021 ) study indicates that the 
sexualization in some advertisements extends even to underage adolescent girls.
Despite these cultural variations, a striking uniformity in racial representation is evident 
across the AI systems (see example Figure 17), predominantly reflecting the dominance of 
white female figures—a reflection of Western-centrism and postcolonial legacies in global 
science and technology (Amit Prasad 2016 , 2019 ). This phenomenon underscores the 
need for a posthumanist interrogation of how technological futures are imagined and 
whose visions dominate these imaginations.
Furthermore, the analysis shows a significant heterogeneity in how Chinese and Western AI 
systems represent female cyborgs in various scenarios. Chinese AI tends to vary dramatically, 
from minimal technological elements in domestic and workplace settings to highly technolo -
gized portrayals in combat scenarios (see example Figure 18). This sharp contrast vividly 
demonstrates how technology is perceived as a tool to empower and grant independence 
to women in extreme imaginations of female roles.

This contract resonates with the portrayal of female characters in Chinese science fiction. 
Scholars such as Mengtian Sun (2023 ) have noted that female authors have introduced new 
gender perspectives to Chinese science fiction in the twenty-first century. However, this 
progress is gradual, and existing gender norms and cultural traditions still influence the 
portrayal of female roles (Angie Chau 2024 ).
In contrast, Western AI systems maintain a consistent integration of futuristic elements 
across scenarios, suggesting a more uniform vision of future female roles. This consistency 
versus variability might reflect broader cultural narratives about the role of technology in 
empowering women, where Western narratives often continuously push for a technologically 
integrated future, while Chinese narratives may display a selective embrace of technology, 
influenced by traditional roles.
These observations resonate with shifts in science fiction literature and film, where 
there has been a move away from heteronormative and male-centered norms (Patricia 
Melzer 2006 ). In recent years, there has also been increasing scholarly attention to non- 
Western cultural imaginations of the future, such as those from China (Zhaokai Hu, Roslina 
Ismail and Changsong Wang 2024 ; Weiyi Wu 2023 ), South Korea (Sayan Chattopadhyay  
2023 ), Pakistan (Shazia Sadaf and Aroosa Kanwal 2023 ), and the Global South (Arindam 
Das and Subhasis Ray 2024 ). Yet, the slow feedback of cultural diversity into AI’s imagin -
ings points to a gap between contemporary cultural shifts and AI representations.
Discussion
From the analysis above, we can see that while AI systems from different cultural back -
grounds exhibit variations in gender expression, racial representation, and scenario 
Figure 18. Female cyborg generated by Shuhua.FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES
 19
settings, they fundamentally reveal the complex interplay and resonance between AI 
imagination and human imagination.
In China, for instance, the conservatism embedded in societal culture often results in AI 
representations of women that appear more traditional in domestic and work scenarios. 
Conversely, in combat scenarios, these representations shift dramatically to depict 
women with pronounced strength and independence. This dichotomy in portrayal may 
reflect the ongoing cultural oscillation in modern China between adhering to traditional 
values and embracing modern, progressive roles for women. Such a split underscores the 
tension within Chinese society as it navigates between historical cultural norms and the 
thrust towards modernization.
In Western contexts, the cultural valorization of sexual openness, while ostensibly 
a mark of progressive attitudes towards gender, sometimes paradoxically translates into 
AI representations that objectify and sexualize women. This phenomenon highlights 
persistent challenges in achieving true gender equality in Western societies, where the 
superficial embrace of sexual liberation can still perpetuate traditional objectifications 
under the guise of modernity.
These manifestations of AI also reflect the differing interpretations of posthumanism 
between China and the West. Posthumanism, originating in the West, emphasizes the 
dissolution of boundaries between human and machine, envisioning robots as figures of 
empowerment and liberation that challenge existing social norms. This boundary- 
breaking approach resonates with the tendency of Western AI to apply a consistent 
futuristic aesthetic across all scenarios. In contrast, China’s interpretation of posthuman -
ism focuses on a fusion of tradition and modernity, underpinned by a Confucian-inspired 
ideal of balance. However, within this pursuit of balance lies a subtle critique of traditional 
power structures, as seen through the representation of female cyborgs as active comba -
tants. This portrayal suggests an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with societal constraints, 
presenting an image that is simultaneously grounded in cultural heritage and charged 
with the potential for transformation.
Limitations
In acknowledging the limitations of this study, it is essential to consider several aspects 
that could influence the interpretation of the findings and the broader implications of the 
research. Firstly, the sample size and the selection of generative AI systems represent 
potential biases and limitations. The AI platforms chosen, while diverse, offer only 
a snapshot of a rapidly evolving field, and the images generated are constrained by the 
platforms’ programming and the inherent biases coded into their algorithms. This limita -
tion is particularly relevant in discussions about the representation of female cyborgs, 
where the diversity of cultural and gender expressions may not be fully captured by the 
selected systems.
Furthermore, the study’s approach to cultural differences, while attempting to high -
light the distinctions between Eastern and Western perceptions of technology and 
gender, may inadvertently simplify the complex dynamics of cultural interactions. This 
simplification risks reducing rich, varied cultural interactions to a binary framework, which 
might not adequately reflect the nuanced ways different cultures engage with and 
influence technological developments.20
 Y. V. LI
Additionally, the analysis in this study is predominantly qualitative, focusing on the-
matic and symbolic interpretations of the images. While this approach provides deep 
insights into the content and context of the images, it lacks the quantitative rigor that 
could validate these findings across a larger dataset.
Conclusion
This study has delved into the portrayal of female cyborgs by eight generative AI systems 
from diverse cultural backgrounds, revealing the complex interplay between technologi -
cal innovation and human cultural imaginations. Through an in-depth analysis of 107 
images across four distinct scenarios, we have observed how AI, while possessing the 
potential to subvert traditional gender norms, often remains tethered to the prevailing 
cultural and social frameworks. The contrasting representations—from the tension 
between tradition and futuristic visions in China’s scene-setting to the sexualized trends 
in Western image designs—illustrate the intricate ways AI interacts with and is shaped by 
human cultural dynamics.
The constant echoes and contradictions between AI and human imagination 
highlight how technology both imitates and enhances human creativity, yet also 
reveals potential contradictions and cultural tensions. These manifestations of AI 
offer a canvas on which globalized technological influences interact with local 
cultural narratives to reconstitute gender imagery. AI’s portrayal of female cyborgs 
does not merely replicate existing biases; it also serves as a medium through which 
these biases can be critically examined and challenged. Here, posthumanism offers 
a valuable lens, advocating for a breakdown of traditional humanist dichotomies 
between nature and technology, the organic and the synthetic, and the fixed 
identities tied to race and gender. By applying a posthumanist critique, we can 
see how AI, as a tool embedded with human cultural codes, has the potential to 
either reinforce traditional gender norms or challenge them by presenting alterna -
tive, fluid, and hybrid gender identities.
To mitigate the gender and cultural biases evident in AI-generated images, developers 
can adopt more inclusive design practices informed by a wider range of cultural perspec -
tives and gender considerations. This approach might involve training algorithms on 
more diverse datasets that reflect global racial, gender, and cultural diversity, ensuring 
a broader representation within AI outputs. Additionally, integrating ethical guidelines 
that address gender and cultural representation directly into the AI design process could 
further reduce the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes. Collaborations with gender 
studies scholars and cultural theorists could provide valuable insights, enhancing the 
cultural sensitivity and inclusivity of AI designs.
Furthermore, the limitations of this study, such as the small sample size and potential 
biases in AI system selection, set a clear agenda for future research. Future studies could 
expand on these findings by exploring a wider array of AI systems and employing 
a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative rigor with qualitative insights. 
Such research could further illuminate how different cultural contexts influence AI’s 
interpretation of gender and humanity, aiding in the development of more culturally 
aware AI systems.FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES

Ultimately, this research contributes to the broader discourse on technology, 
gender, and culture by offering unique insights into how generative AI envisions 
female cyborgs—a core metaphor in posthumanism imbued with the hope of trans -
cending the boundaries between human and machine, nature and culture. This study 
not only reaffirms the role of AI in shaping societal views on gender but also 
challenges it to foster a feminist future that is both deanthropocentric and dewes -
ternized. These reflections invite deeper considerations of power structures, gender 
expression, and cultural differences, underscoring the need for an interdisciplinary 
approach in the ongoing discourse at the intersection of society, culture, and 
technology.
