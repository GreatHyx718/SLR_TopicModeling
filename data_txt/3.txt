Abstract. This paper emphasizes the signiﬁcance of embracing the more-than-
human perspective, which goes beyond conventional human-centered design
approaches and offers a foundation for innovative design methodologies. We will
delve into the fundamental concepts underpinning the more-than-human perspec-
tive, elucidating its core principles. Following this, we will present recommenda-
tions on integrating this perspective into distinct design methodologies, fostering
a comprehensive and inclusive approach to design. Furthermore, the paper will
illuminate the practical implications of adopting the more-than-human perspec-
tive through three detailed case studies. These case studies will serve as practical
illustrations of how this perspective can inﬂuence the design process, unlock novel
design possibilities, and contribute to the development of innovative solutions. By
delving into these real-world scenarios, we aim to showcase the tangible beneﬁts
and transformative potential of the more-than-human perspective in the realm of
design.

1 Hybrid and Entangled World
In recent years, the design ﬁeld has witnessed a growing interest in shifting away from
the traditional human-centric approach, ushering in a more inclusive design paradigm
referred to as More-Than-Human Design (MTHD) [ 9,14,30,35] for investigating a
variety of wicked problems in our entangled world. The term” entangled world” refers
to the interconnectedness and interdependence of various elements and phenomena in
the contemporary global context. It suggests that different aspects of our world—such as
technology, economies, cultures, societies, and the environment—are deeply intertwined
and inﬂuence each other in complex ways. This interconnectedness can be observed
on various levels, including social, economic, political, and environmental dimensions.
Design researchers and practitioners are actively exploring collaborative design methods
and strategies that encompass not only humans but also objects, animals, and robots

as integral constituents of the design process. MTHD research ﬁnds strong resonance
with postpluralist ideologies, including actor-network theory, philosophy of science,
and the critical intersection with posthuman concepts [ 14]. In the domain of human
technology hybrid design, researchers are proactively forging their distinct approaches
and methodologies, ﬁnely tailored to the realm of design. This paradigm shift reﬂects
an evolving landscape in design thinking, where the boundaries of design expand to
accommodate a richer and more diverse set of actors in the design process.
The burgeoning MTHD approach in the design domain exhibits two notable trends.
One of these trends is rooted in the growing environmental crisis, which has led sci-
entists to reevaluate the concept of human dominance over other species [ 8,12,32].
Design methodologies focused on sustainability are moving away from presumptions
of one species’ superiority over another, and instead, they are exploring alternatives
that promote the overall well-being of the ecosystem. Some proponents suggest that
MTHD theory could serve as a valuable framework for reevaluating global human-
nonhuman interactions during the “Anthropocene” epoch, transcending the reliance on
human-centric criteria [ 5].
Another signiﬁcant trend is related to the evolving concept of what deﬁnes a product.
Ac r u c i a ld r i v e rb e h i n dt h i sp r o f o u n ds h i f ti nt h ep r o d u c t ’ sd e ﬁ n i t i o ni st h em o v ef r o m
static physical objects, as commonly seen in traditional “industrial products” to dynamic
and adaptable entities [ 14,38]. This transformation has been signiﬁcantly accelerated by
the widespread integration of connectivity, machine learning, and artiﬁcial intelligence
into our daily lives. The emergence of new sensing technologies and advanced data
processing capabilities has enabled products to undergo substantial evolution, moving
beyond their previous roles as passive objects to become active agents that inﬂuence
relationships and interactions with individuals [ 35]. This change in concept and ontology
prompts a reevaluation of the boundaries between humans and technology.
For instance, domains like virtual reality, social robotics, digital assistants, and neu-
roimplants challenge the conventional boundary between humans and machines, raising
questions about the essence of humanity versus technology. Furthermore, this transition
emphasizes the relational nature of design, positioning intelligence not as an inherent
trait of machines or humans, but as an emergent property arising from their interactions
[36,40]. Designers must now shift their focus away from the traditional singular user
or product to encompass multifaceted considerations involving various products, ser-
vices, stakeholders, and their intricate interplay. This shift presents a challenge to the
established paradigm of human-centered design [ 9,14,16,32]. Together, these elements
suggest the potential for a paradigm shift in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), mark-
ing the advent of the third wave of HCI [ 4]. However, it’s important to note that the HCI
and design discourse on MTHD is still in its early stages [ 14].
This paper focuses on the “more-than-human” perspective, departing from conven-
tional human-centered design paradigms to encompass nonhuman elements. Its purpose
is to introduce the foundational concepts that underpin this perspective and explore
the potential for innovative design methodologies it offers. Additionally, it delves into
how the more-than-human perspective can impact design through the lens of three case
74 R. Kimura and T. Nakajima
studies. It’s clear that this emerging perspective, in contrast to the traditional human-
centered design approach, provides a spectrum of viewpoints and the potential to unlock
new possibilities.
2 Research Background
2.1 Agential Realism and Entanglement
Agential realism is a theoretical approach rooted in the entanglement theory of physics,
conceptualizing the close interconnection of matter and meaning, as well as human
beings and the environment. Proposed by physicist and philosopher Karen Barad and
extensively detailed in her primary work, “Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum
Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning” [ 3], the theory employs the
notion of agential cuts to underscore the process of segregating material agency and
situating it within speciﬁc relationships and states.
Fig. 1. Agential Realism and Agential Cuts
Agential realism introduces the concept of “intra-action” to emphasize that entities
(both human and nonhuman) do not preexist their interactions but rather emerge through
those interactions. This challenges traditional notions of interaction and causality. Intra-
action underscores the entanglement of different elements and the continuous process
of becoming through their relations. Also, agential realism stresses the agency of both
human and nonhuman actors. It recognizes that material entities, such as technologies
and objects, play an active role in shaping social practices. The material world is not
passive but actively participates in the constitution of reality.
As illustrated in Fig. 1,a g e n t i a lc u t sr e j e c tt h ed i c h o t o m yb e t w e e nm a t e r i a la n d
meaning, deﬁning agency interactions with precision. This process is arbitrary, allowing
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 75
researchers and observers to opt for different cuts. The ﬂexibility and richness of agential
realism emerge from these various cuts, generating diverse understandings and interpre-
tations. In this theory, the separation facilitated by agential cuts signiﬁes an inseparable
interrelationship between the observer and the observed. Implicit in the observer’s anal-
ysis of the object is the notion that the observer is intricately intertwined with the object.
This introduces a novel theoretical approach to the intricate interactions of matter and
humanity, meaning and the environment, fostering a comprehensive understanding of
the entangled phenomenon.
2.2 Actor Network Theory
Latour criticizes the concept of “social explanations” rooted in the binary division of
society and the individual, which is prevalent in traditional sociology and, in his view,
overly simplistic and homogenous [ 31]. He labels this as the “sociology of society.” In
contrast, Latour advocates for a “sociology of relations,” a perspective that emphasizes
the intricate and unpredictable interactions among actors in everyday practices, where
individual “actor” entities play essential roles in reshaping various aspects of the world
[31]. In this framework, “society” is no longer the central focus of analysis; instead,
attention shifts to the connections between actors and the dynamic processes through
which these connections undergo transformation.
From this perspective, Actor-Network Theory (ANT) provides a unique analytical
approach compared to traditional HCI methodologies. ANT places its emphasis on the
interrelated and inseparable nature of various actors, including humans, objects, social
factors, and technology. Services, in essence, emerge as hybrid networks composed of
these human, object, social, and technological elements, requiring their consideration
as a uniﬁed entity. Changes in one actor are understood to have an impact on the entire
network. Therefore, when exploring the meaning of services concerning the affordances
provided by these hybrid networks, it’s inadequate to focus solely on human actors. It
is essential to reevaluate the dynamic behaviors of stakeholders from a perspective that
encompasses both humans and their associated actors. This opens up new interpretations
that diverge from traditional research and provide insights into novel understandings that
take into account the inﬂuence of nonhuman actors.
ANT conceives social phenomena as intricate networks involving a diverse array of
actors. It adopts a relational perspective in which every actor, be it human, natural object,
artifact, or any other element, is intricately interconnected, forming an inseparable net-
work [ 7]. The actor-network is a concept that not only encompasses human connections
but also signiﬁes a condition in which various actors, including humans, objects, society,
technology, and nature, are interlinked and function as indivisible entities. Each actor
is accorded equal status as a constituent of this network. Latour further characterizes
ANT as a “sociology of translation,” asserting that there are no notions of society, social
domains, or social bonds. The essence of ANT lies in tracing the translation activities
undertaken by the actors that constitute the network.
Despite their distinct theoretical origins, both agential realism and ANT share a com-
mon emphasis on relationships and interactions for attacking a variety of wicked prob-
lems in our entangled world. They diverge from reductionist perspectives and recognize
76 R. Kimura and T. Nakajima
the intricate connections within systems. While agential realism underscores entangle-
ment and the inseparability of the observer and the observed, ANT focuses on networks
of relations among various actors. The interplay of these perspectives enriches our com-
prehension of complex phenomena. Therefore, agential realism and ANT contribute to
an u a n c e du n d e r s t a n d i n go fc o m p l e xs y s t e m s ,e a c hp r o v i d i n gu n i q u ei n s i g h t si n t ot h e
relational nature of phenomena while stemming from different academic disciplines.
2.3 Posthuman and Speculative Realism
Contemporary developments in posthumanism focus on the interaction between humans
and technology, exploring key themes that leverage cutting-edge technologies such as vir-
tual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). These technologies aim to enhance human
capabilities and perceptions, create new realities, and transcend physical constraints [ 5,
13,18,19].
The ontological shift represents a signiﬁcant advancement in posthumanism, moving
beyond the limits of anthropocentrism to emphasize the status and agency of nonhuman
entities [ 21]. This includes exploring the complex relationships with nonhuman ele-
ments, like animals, technology, and the environment, and examining their impact on
the shaping of society. Ethical perspectives are also under scrutiny, encompassing rela-
tionships with animals, the use of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and autonomous technology,
and environmental consequences—all while taking into account the needs and interests
of nonhuman entities.
Furthermore, contemporary posthumanism focuses on the human body and physical-
ity, as well as the integration of humans and technology facilitated by advances in biotech-
nology, wearable devices, and human-machine interfaces. Environmental posthumanism
emphasizes the interconnectedness of humans and the environment, breaking down the
traditional human-nature binary. In this context, research explores the ecological impact
of human activities and their interplay with the environment.
Lastly, posthumanism explores scenarios in which the boundary between human and
nonhuman existence becomes blurred, along with considerations about future existence
and intelligence. These discussions are of paramount importance in the context of ethical
implications and challenges associated with technological interactions. Recent trends in
posthumanism bring forth new perspectives on human-technology interactions, and we
are deeply concerned about their far-reaching implications.
Speculative Realism encompasses a collection of philosophical movements within
contemporary philosophy that challenge conventional philosophical paradigms [ 20]. A
fundamental characteristic of this philosophical wave is its critical departure from estab-
lished anthropocentrism and subjectivism. Speculative realist philosophers emphasize
the existence not only of human beings but also of matter, nature, and the universe. They
argue that these entities possess autonomy and signiﬁcance.
The connection between speculative ontology and posthumanism can be elucidated
through the following pivotal points. Firstly, in their exploration of concepts, both engage
in imaginative and creative conceptual investigations, encouraging us to contemplate
novel facets of reality. Speculative ontology delves deeply into the nature of reality,
whereas posthumanism encourages us to envision future possibilities among diverse
entities, transcending our current understanding.
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 77
Secondly, in their efforts to dismantle anthropocentrism, both challenge conventional
anthropocentric viewpoints. Instead, they offer more inclusive perspectives that recog-
nize the subjectivity and signiﬁcance of nonhuman entities. Additionally, within their
ethical considerations, both frameworks incorporate ethical concerns. Speculative ontol-
ogy scrutinizes the ethical ramiﬁcations of hypothetical scenarios, while posthumanism
centers on ethical issues like human augmentation and environmental impact.
Finally, in relation to speculative posthuman futures, speculative ontology and
posthumanism share a mutual interest in the future. Speculative ontology explores pos-
sibilities that extend beyond the traditional human condition, whereas posthumanism
contemplates a future shaped by technological, ecological, and social transformations.
In summary, speculative ontology and posthumanism enhance our understanding of real-
ity and existence, prompting us to reconsider our relationship with the world and the
uncharted possibilities that lie ahead.
2.4 Anthropology and Ontological Turn
The ontological turn in anthropology signiﬁes a signiﬁcant paradigm shift that unfolded
in the early 21st century, representing an effort to question conventional methodologies
and reevaluate the nature of human existence and social realities [ 15,21]. Unlike earlier
approaches that focused on external observations and analyses of culture and society, the
ontological turn adopts a distinct viewpoint, centered on the multifaceted and intricate
ways in which individuals perceive and engage with their own world [ 10,24,30].
The ontological turn in anthropology exhibits several distinctive features:
1. Recognition of Diverse Ontologies: This shift acknowledges that various cultures and
social groups hold distinct ontological perspectives. It challenges the assumption of
as i n g l e ,u n i v e r s a lr e a l i t ya n du n d e r s c o r e st h ec o e x i s t e n c eo fm u l t i p l eo n t o l o g i c a l
viewpoints. Anthropologists embracing the ontological turn value and respect these
differing beliefs, striving to comprehend the various realities they entail.
2. Relational Nature of Existence: This paradigm shift examines the interrelationships
between humans and nonhuman entities. It challenges anthropocentric Cartesian
dualism, emphasizing the interconnectedness and interdependence of all beings.
3. Reevaluation of Subjectivity: The ontological turn reevaluates conventional notions
of subjectivity and personality. It questions the assumption that only humans possess
subjectivity and inﬂuence over social and natural phenomena. Instead, it offers a fresh
perspective on the constituent elements that constitute personhood.
Indeed, the ontological shift in anthropology signiﬁes a fundamental change in per-
spective. It highlights the signiﬁcance of comprehending and honoring diverse onto-
logical convictions and the intricate interplay between humans and their surroundings.
Through an inclusive and participatory approach, anthropologists aim to cultivate a
deeper appreciation of the intricacies inherent in human existence and social reality. This
paradigm shift not only enriches the ﬁeld of anthropology but also makes meaningful
contributions to wider discussions on cultural diversity, indigenous rights, environmental
conservation, and various other pertinent topics.

2.5 Affordance and Thoughtless Act
Suri’s concepts of the “Thoughtless Act” and “affordance” hold signiﬁcance in com-
prehending human interactions with their environment within the realm of design [ 45].
“Thoughtless Act”, as articulated by Suri, pertains to those minor actions that individuals
perform in their everyday lives without conscious deliberation. These actions typically
arise from what are known as “affordances” embedded in familiar situations and envi-
ronments. The notion of “affordance” was originally introduced by Gibson [ 17]a n d
refers to the inherent potential behaviors and interaction opportunities that an object or
environment offers based on its physical attributes and human capabilities. For instance,
ac h a i ra f f o r d ss i t t i n g ,ad o o r k n o ba f f o r d st u r n i n g ,a n dat o u c h s c r e e na f f o r d st a p p i n g .
These concepts shed light on how individuals instinctively and intuitively respond to
their surroundings, guided by their perception of these affordances. From a design per-
spective, comprehending these subconscious human behaviors can lead to the creation
of more effective designs. By taking into account the affordances presented by design
elements, designers are better equipped to deliver intuitive and user-friendly experiences.
Individuals frequently perceive affordances, a phenomenon driven by their adaptive
capacity shaped by previous experiences and the contextual factors in their surroundings.
This perceptual process often results in actions performed instinctively, with individuals
responding in accordance with their perceived affordances. Consequently, unconscious
actions inﬂuenced by affordances play a pivotal role in how we navigate objects and
spaces, fostering innovative approaches and novel uses. When affordances are transpar-
ent and intuitive, individuals are more inclined to experiment with diverse methods and
explore innovative ideas. The comprehension of unconscious behavior and affordances
carries immense signiﬁcance in user-centered design. Designers endeavor to ensure that
design elements align with people’s inherent inclinations, facilitating users to engage in
an intuitive experience with minimal cognitive load. In essence, the concepts of “unthink-
ing action” and “affordance” constitute fundamental aspects in comprehending people’s
subconscious behaviors and interactions with their environment within the realm of
design, ultimately contributing to the attainment of more effective design solutions.
2.6 Safety-I and Safety-II
In a context distinct from anthropology, a parallel trend is emerging, centering around
discussions related to the ontological shift. Safety-II, an approach to safety endorsed
by prominent international human factors authorities like Hollnagel, places its focus on
adaptive ﬂexibility to ensure and enhance safety, in contrast to the traditional Safety-
Ia p p r o a c ht h a tp r i m a r i l ys e e k st oe l i m i n a t eh u m a ne r r o r[ 22]. Human error, viewed
as a root cause of accidents, is deﬁned as “human actions leading to unintended con-
sequences,” and the conventional approach has revolved around the minimization of
human error to ensure safety. This involves preventing “deviations from predeﬁned and
correct procedures” while emphasizing the enhancement of human reliability. Crucially,
the safety of a technical system hinges on its proper functioning. Systems that operate
ﬂawlessly contribute to safety, while those that malfunction are prone to accidents. This
concept extends its applicability to both physical systems and business processes. In
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 79
the pursuit of safety, enhancing human reliability becomes imperative, with the ultimate
goal of reducing the incidence of human error to nearly zero.
Safety-I primarily approaches safety from a technical standpoint, operating under the
premise that accidents can be averted by correct system operation. Nevertheless, Safety-
I, on its own, may not offer a comprehensive solution for accident prevention within
complex social and natural settings. In contrast, Safety-II places a strong emphasis on
adapting to varying situations and circumstances, aiming to secure safety by enhancing
human reliability. Referred to as resilience, this approach underscores the enhancement
of coordination competencies. Safety-II represents a reevaluation of the conventional
safety paradigm, aligning it with the requirements of contemporary society. The term
“resilience” ﬁnds applications across diverse ﬁelds, encompassing biology, ecology, and
psychology, and underscores the capacity for adaptability and robustness. In the context
of Safety-II, the goal is to optimize the resilience of the system, requiring a focus on
management responsibilities as a pivotal component of the approach.
3 More-than-Human Perspectives and Postpluralism
3.1 Superhuman
The connection between the concept of “superhumans” and technology is multifaceted.
Generally, “superhumans” surpass the conventional duality of nature and society, pos-
sessing extraordinary capabilities that exceed those of typical individuals. Technology
serves as a facilitator or ampliﬁer for these superhuman capacities.
1. Human Augmentation: Technology provides the tools to enhance physical capabil-
ities. Artiﬁcial limbs, exoskeletons, brain-computer interfaces, and similar devices
have the potential to signiﬁcantly improve the abilities of individuals with physical
disabilities, elevating them to superhuman levels.
2. Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Cognitive Enhancement: Cutting-edge artiﬁcial intelli-
gence can perform complex tasks at high speeds and sometimes exhibit cognitive
abilities that exceed those of humans. Machine learning and natural language pro-
cessing have the potential to enhance human cognition and improve decision-making
processes.
3. Biohacking and Transhumanism: Through genetic engineering and nanotechnology,
biohacking aims to enhance both the body and the mind, potentially paving the way
for the development of superhuman attributes.
4. Cybernetics and Cyborgs: The convergence of humans and machines through cyber-
netics has the potential to create cyborgs and amplify human capabilities. For example,
brain-computer interfaces can enhance cognition and memory.
5. Blurred Boundaries: The interaction between technology and superhuman enhance-
ments blurs the lines between humans and machines, prompting profound philosoph-
ical inquiries. This intersection gives rise to profound questions about the essence of
humanity and individual identity.
Technology plays a pivotal role in shaping and redeﬁning the concept of “super-
human.” However, it is of paramount importance to adopt a balanced approach that
considers ethical considerations and social repercussions.

3.2 Hybrids and Boundary Objects
The connection between ANT and hybrids plays a fundamental role in understanding
the complexities of the social domain. ANT challenges traditional social theories by pre-
senting a network-centric perspective in which various actors, including both human and
nonhuman elements, inﬂuence each other. Hybridity, a conceptual framework, explains
how diverse actors come together within the network to create new entities or assem-
blages. According to the ANT paradigm, actors encompass not only humans but also any
conceivable entities, such as animals, technology, institutions, ideas, and natural forces.
These actors interconnect to form networks that are in a constant state of change. ANT
assigns equal importance to all actors and views agency as dispersed and dependent on
relationships.
Hybrids are essentially products or combinations that emerge as a result of diverse
actors inﬂuencing each other, creating new connections and interdependencies. They
serve as evidence of the fresh meanings and capabilities that result from these intricate
interactions among actors. Hybrids can take on either stable or transient forms, depending
on how these interconnected actors come together. The primary purpose of hybrids is
to provide a framework for understanding how different actors connect, interact, and
shape the social landscape. This concept of hybrids is invaluable for understanding the
complexities of organizational restructuring, transformation, and societal evolution. In
essence, actor-network theory introduces a novel approach that enables a comprehensive
understanding of the vast diversity and complexity inherent in the real world.
Boundary objects are a pivotal concept in sociology and in the realm of scientiﬁc
and technological research, where they serve various roles across different communities.
These objects represent ﬂexible units of information and data, open to different interpre-
tations within diverse communities. However, beneath this diversity, they encapsulate a
core identity or content that remains consistent. The concept of boundary objects was
ﬁrst introduced in 1989 by Star and her colleagues [ 43]. These objects play a vital role
in fostering adaptability and resilience among various stakeholders working collabora-
tively. While they assume varied meanings across disparate social contexts, they share
ac o m m o nu n d e r l y i n gs t r u c t u r e .A ss u c h ,t h e yf u n c t i o na sam e d i u mf o rf a c i l i t a t i n g
information recognition and translation between distinct communities.
The concept of boundary objects is widely accepted and applicable across a range
of ﬁelds, including computer science, informatics, and management. Their adaptability
allows them to meet the diverse requirements of different organizations and communities,
serving as a medium for effective collaboration on shared tasks. Boundary objects play a
signiﬁcant role by having the ability to reconcile localized understandings among various
actors and coordinate them, even in the absence of complete consensus. Furthermore, the
concept of boundary objects has expanded and has been applied to facilitate cooperation
between disparate communities and domains. They inﬂuence the meaning-making pro-
cess, especially in interdisciplinary and cross-cultural communication, harnessing the
potential of digital technologies to enable users to customize boundary objects to their
speciﬁc needs.

3.3 Co-performance and Practice Theory
Co-performance aims to provide researchers and practitioners of HCI with a new per-
spective on the role of artiﬁcial agency in everyday life [ 29]. Co-performance is devel-
oped based on the practice theory [ 37,41]a n dm a k et h ed e s i g nf o c u sf r o mt h ei s s u e
of agency distribution during design to the issue of embodied learning of both human
and artiﬁcial performers in everyday practice. The perspective recognizes the dynamic
differences between human and artiﬁcial capabilities and emphasizes the fundamentally
inverse relationship between professional design and use.
Agency in the practice theory refers to the ability or capacity to act that is demon-
strated through the performance of a practice. According to Schatzki, agency is classiﬁed
into two types: causal and performance [ 41]. Causal agency relates to making something
happen or helping it happen, while performance agency is the performance of an action
in a particular situation, while at the same time continuing the practice of which it is
ap a r t .T h ep e r f o r m a n c eo fap r a c t i c et i e dt oa ne n t i t ya sas o c i a lp r a c t i c ei sas o c i a l l y
shared idea of appropriate practice and persists across time and space. Social practice
consists of the sum of its performances, each performance representing a reinterpretation
of appropriate behavior in a situation. Performance is an important factor in shaping and
changing social practice.
Social practices are ideas of appropriate forms of shared and materially embed-
ded action. These are not abstract entities, but concrete knowledge and know-how as
“body/mind” [ 37]. The concept of co-performance applies this to both humans and
artifacts, emphasizing that changes in social practice involve concrete learning. In line
with repeated performances and altered bodies/minds, ideas of appropriate practices are
embodied and changed in the bodies/minds of both humans and artifacts. In other words,
what is considered appropriate is adaptive in context and changes over time, but from
ad e s i g np e r s p e c t i v e ,t h ec o l l a b o r a t i o nw i l lf o c u so nt h ec h a n g i n gd i v i s i o no fr o l e sa n d
responsibilities between human and artifact body/mind and envision appropriate inter-
actions between them. The co-performance integrates all the elements mentioned by
Reckwitz [ 37]i nt h es i t u a t i o na n di n t e g r a t et h e mi n t ot h ee m b o d i m e n to ft h ep r a c t i c e
in a way that makes sense and also summarized by Shove et al. as meanings, materials,
and competences [ 42]. In this way, the social practice is jointly formed by the human
and the artifact.
This approach is consistent with the idea of interaction and reciprocity between
nonhuman actions and human objectives in HCI, but focuses on the level of social prac-
tice rather than interaction, and on the passage of time rather than just speciﬁc actions,
which offers a new perspective on recursive relationships from a design perspective.
Co-performance requires that design must follow at the time of use, and at the time of
design involves the embodiment of ideas about speciﬁc appropriate performances, and
in interaction with the human performer, the artiﬁcial performer’s embodied tendencies
may lead to “appropriate” performances and inhibit others. Important in this interac-
tion are the differences between human and artiﬁcial body/mind and how these can be
capitalized both during design and during use.

3.4 Invisible Things and Affordance
Smart cities are initiatives aimed at addressing a variety of local challenges through
the deployment of cutting-edge technologies to improve urban and regional functions
and services [ 1,48]. This effort promises increased comfort and added value. By sys-
tematically monitoring various aspects within a city and leveraging computer software,
processes can be automated, and resources can be used more efﬁciently. Smart cities have
now become a focal point not only for the research community but also for businesses
and policymakers alike. However, the distinction between smart cities and digital trans-
formation (DX) has become increasingly blurred, complicating understanding for those
involved in these domains. To address these complex issues, adopting an affordance
perspective offers a valuable approach. This perspective is well-suited for designing and
analyzing multifaceted platforms like smart cities. Smart cities use technology to visu-
alize aspects of urban life that remain imperceptible to the naked eye, enabling them
to adapt services in real-time to current conditions. Moreover, these visual represen-
tations of various urban phenomena empower citizens to lead comfortable lives while
remaining aware of potential urban challenges. However, as exempliﬁed in works like
“Hyper-Reality,” we must exercise caution, as an excessive provision of affordances
can inadvertently transform society into a dystopian reality [ 34]. It’s worth noting that
visualizing the imperceptible may lead to particular interpretations inﬂuenced by the
designer’s intentions [ 46]. Thus, careful attention is imperative when designing visually
presented affordances.
As mentioned earlier, the concept of affordance pertains to the potential actions and
utility offered by a speciﬁc environment or object, often shaped by concealed attributes
and elements. This concept is a focal point in the realms of cognitive science and epis-
temology, closely entwined with imperceptible elements. It encompasses the range of
actions and uses implied by an object’s or environment’s characteristics, including not
only those attributes readily discernible by sight but also the hidden elements that inﬂu-
ence these affordances. For instance, consider a doorknob as part of an object, facili-
tating the affordance of turning. In this instance, the action of turning, though invisible
in itself, holds paramount signiﬁcance. Affordances associated with an environment or
object may extend to include attributes or information not visible to the eye. For exam-
ple, stairs provide affordances for ascending and descending, yet they are inﬂuenced by
factors that evade visual detection, such as step height and the presence of handrails.
These concealed attributes assist individuals in their actions and decision-making when
using stairs. In the realm of technology and systems, invisible elements can similarly
contribute to the formation of affordances. Take, for example, a smartphone’s touch-
screen, which can detect ﬁnger movements and touch pressure, offering corresponding
operations and functions. The affordances provided by these touchscreens depend on
unseen sensor technology and software features.
In essence, the concepts of affordances and invisible elements share a symbiotic
relationship. When we seek to comprehend the spectrum of actions and utilities offered
by an object or environment, it is imperative that we consider the presence of these
imperceptible elements. Affordances, coupled with the inﬂuence of concealed attributes
and elements, underpin human actions and decisions, enabling individuals to effectively
engage with objects and surroundings. These perspectives hold particular signiﬁcance
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 83
in the context of comprehending postpluralism, where the intricate interplay between
nature and society unfolds in multifaceted ways.
3.5 Postphenomenology and Multistability
Postphenomenology is a philosophical framework ﬁrmly grounded in the tradition of
phenomenology [ 23,39]. It seeks to uphold the core tenets of phenomenology while
engaging in an extensive examination of the profound impact of technology on human
experience and perception. Here is a brief overview of some of the central principles of
postphenomenology:
1. Technological Mediation: Postphenomenology places signiﬁcant emphasis on the
role of technology as a vital medium through which we interact with the external
world and with each other. It delves into the diverse forms of technology, encompass-
ing smartphones, medical devices, and more, to investigate how they inﬂuence our
perception, cognition, and physical bodies.
2. Embodiment and Perception: Postphenomenologists delve into the intricate relation-
ship between technology and our bodies, as well as how it molds our perceptions.
This inquiry extends to examining how technology enhances our sensory experiences,
such as through the use of hearing aids and virtual reality goggles.
3. Human-Technology Relationship: Postphenomenology scrutinizes the intricate rela-
tionship between humans and technology, underscoring that technology is not merely
at o o lb u ta na c t i v ee n t i t yt h a ts h a p e so u re x p e r i e n c e sa n dp e r s p e c t i v e s .
In addition, the concept of “multistability” holds signiﬁcance in postphenomenology.
It pertains to the idea that technology can provide multiple distinct yet stable interpre-
tations or perceptions of the same phenomenon. This concept gains particular relevance
in the realm of postphenomenology, which posits that technology introduces a multi-
tude of perspectives into our perceptions. Postphenomenology provides a philosophical
framework for comprehending this diversity and intricacy inherent to technology.
Postphenomenology departs from the standpoint that technology actively shapes our
worldview and perceptual faculties, and it is far from being a neutral tool. In this con-
text, the diversity introduced by technology implies the potential for a range of stable
interpretations and experiences regarding a particular situation or phenomenon. These
multiple interpretations can arise from the presence or use of speciﬁc technologies, as
well as physical alterations. Examples of postphenomenological multiplicity include
digital photography and AR. In the realm of digital photography, for instance, the same
photograph can assume distinct interpretations and meanings through editing and the
application of ﬁlters. Consequently, technology introduces a sense of multiplicity into
the perception of a photograph. Conversely, AR overlays digital information onto the
physical environment, creating a scenario where different layers of reality coexist. With
AR, we simultaneously perceive both reality and digital information, thereby infusing
multiplicity into our perception. In this philosophical context, postphenomenology’s
notion of multiplicity challenges the idea of a single, objective reality and suggests that
our experiences are signiﬁcantly shaped by the technology we engage with. Further-
more, it’s essential to recognize that different technologies yield varying interpretations
and experiences of the same phenomenon. Postphenomenologists use the concept of
84 R. Kimura and T. Nakajima
multistability to examine how technology mediates our experiences and how divergent
technologies give rise to diverse interpretations of reality.

4.1 Overview
By integrating the more-than-human perspective, this study delves into three case studies
within the philosophical framework of three distinct concepts: postpluralistic ontology,
affordance, and, notably, a hybrid perspective.
Postpluralistic ontology represents a philosophical perspective that extends beyond
the conventional singular and monistic interpretation of reality. Within this framework,
it acknowledges the existence of diverse forms of reality and modes of existence. Post-
pluralist ontology rejects the notion of a solitary, uniﬁed reality, recognizing instead a
multitude of distinct levels or modes of existence. These encompass physical, spiritual,
social, cultural, and various other dimensions. This ontology underscores the coexistence
and interplay among these diverse ontologies, unveiling the intricate nature of reality. It
challenges the concept of a solitary, objective reality, opting instead for the recognition
of multiple, interwoven realities.
The concept of affordances, as introduced in Sect. 2,i sp r e d o m i n a n t l yu t i l i z e dw i t h i n
cognitive science and ecopsychology to elucidate the possibilities for action and interac-
tion presented by environments and objects to individuals. It posits that environments and
objects possess distinct properties and characteristics, shaping how individuals can utilize
and engage with them. Affordances are intricately linked to an individual’s capabilities,
intentions, and perceptions. Recognizing these affordances aids individuals in under-
standing and discerning their surroundings, enabling them to take action and navigate
within them effectively. The signiﬁcance of postpluralistic ontology and affordance lies
in their collective contribution to comprehending the dynamic and multifaceted nature
of reality, perception, and interaction. Particularly within the context of postpluralistic
ontology, the concept of affordance extends beyond physical attributes, encompassing
various ontologies and forms of existence. Affordance is not conﬁned to the physical
realm but extends to encompass spiritual, social, and cultural dimensions. Consequently,
individuals perceive affordances through their interactions with these diverse ontologies
and forms of existence. In a world where multiple ontological layers and realities coex-
ist, it becomes evident that a single object or phenomenon can present several different
affordances. Individuals or groups, inﬂuenced by distinct ontological perspectives, may
discern diverse affordances for the same object or situation. This underscores the intricate
interplay between postpluralistic ontology and the concept of affordances.
The coexistence of multiple ontologies and affordances underscores the intri-
cate nature of human-environment interactions. Postpluralistic ontology challenges the
notion of a singular, objective reality, while the concept of affordance acknowledges
the pivotal role of perception and action in shaping our experiences within these mul-
tifarious realities. Both postpluralistic ontology and the concept of affordance share a
common emphasis on the diversity of existence and the various ways individuals per-
ceive and engage with their surroundings. By comprehending and applying the concept
of affordance within the framework of postpluralistic ontology, we gain insights into how
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 85
diverse ontological perspectives shape the perception of affordance within a complex
and interdependent world. This approach allows us to explore the profound inﬂuence of
different ontological viewpoints on our interactions with the environment, enriching our
understanding of the multifaceted nature of reality.
4.2 Collective Sharing Human Eyes and Ears
The initial case study revolves around a digital platform designed to aggregate a diverse
array of perspectives and viewpoints contributed by individuals worldwide. These indi-
vidual viewpoints, or listening points, are then digitized, as illustrated in Fig. 2,a n d
replicated within a virtual environment for further data processing. The ultimate objec-
tive is to reassemble these gathered perspectives and listening points into innovative
hybrid entities, which are subsequently presented in the physical world. The overarch-
ing goal of this endeavor is to prompt users to recognize the richness of global diversity
and broaden their horizons.

niﬁcant emphasis on hybrid viewpoints. Nevertheless, there is an opportunity to broaden
the range of applications that digital platforms can offer by taking into account the context
of the contributors of these viewpoints and listening points. In a more advanced iter-
ation introduced in [ 28], known as Posthuman CollectiveEyes, the platform leverages
the contextual information of the individuals from whom these viewpoints and listening
points are collected. This opens up new potential use cases, essentially suggesting the
expansion of possibilities by treating viewpoints and listening points as hybrid entities
and constructing networks centered around them.
These examples revolve around the affordances associated with two distinct hybrids.
The ﬁrst hybrid concerns the affordances of viewpoints and listening points contributed
by individuals. In the initial iterations of CollectiveEyes and CollectiveEars, the networks
86 R. Kimura and T. Nakajima
supporting these hybrids were simpliﬁed, primarily relying on context-independent
viewpoints and listening points. However, subsequent enhancements delve deeper into
the network of viewpoints and listening points, considering the affordances of this hybrid
in various contexts. The second hybrid focuses on the affordances generated by the amal-
gamation of collected viewpoints and listening points. The affordances of this hybrid
enable the synthesis of multiple viewpoints, facilitating the construction of meaning
for the user. For instance, by presenting the user with perspectives from diverse angles
of their current location, this amalgamated hybrid of multiple viewpoints can offer a
multifaceted understanding of that particular place.
4.3 Gamiﬁcation Design from a Hybrids’ Perspective
Gamiﬁcation is a strategy used to enhance user motivation and engagement by incorpo-
rating elements and principles commonly found in games into non-game environments
[11]. Its application spans diverse domains, including education, business, healthcare,
and marketing, among others. The primary goal of gamiﬁcation is to encourage task
completion and promote behavioral changes. This is achieved by introducing various
components such as points, badges, rankings, competitions, missions, and rewards, all
designed to inject an element of enjoyment and achievement into the user experience.
Recognized for its effectiveness, gamiﬁcation serves as a valuable tool for increasing user
engagement, facilitating goal achievement, and instilling lasting behavioral patterns.
Fig. 3. Hybrids in a Gamiﬁed Service
Traditional gamiﬁcation approaches have primarily focused on using game elements
to enhance user motivation. In contrast, this second case study explores the affordances
provided by hybrids, which consist of a combination of game elements, human elements,
and nonhuman elements, while also considering the intricate interplay between these
components. As depicted in Fig. 3,t h ei n n e r m o s th y b r i dc o n s i s t ss o l e l yo fg a m ee l e -
ments. The subsequent layers of hybrids include both human and nonhuman elements,
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 87
directly interacting with game elements, and they create affordances through their inter-
connected relationships. The outermost hybrid encompasses not only the human and
nonhuman elements directly involved but also those indirectly connected to the process.
Through an analysis of these distinct hybrids, we aim to understand the diverse impacts of
various hybrid layers on user motivation. Speciﬁcally, as the network of relevant human
and nonhuman elements within a service becomes more intricate, multiple hybrids that
incorporate the same game elements can emerge. In such cases, friction between these
hybrids can lead to complex shifts in user motivation. By shifting the focus toward
hybrids, this case study provides fresh insights into the design of complex gamiﬁcation
services that cannot be adequately addressed through traditional human-centered design
methodologies.
4.4 Paragraphica: An AI-Enhanced Context-to-Image Camera
Fig. 4. Paragraphica
The third and ﬁnal case study is Paragraphica, developed by Karmann1.P a r a g r a p h i c a
is a context-to-image camera that employs location and artiﬁcial intelligence technology
to generate visual representations of speciﬁc places and moments. These cameras exist
in both physical prototype and virtual forms, which can be experimented with. Figure 4
showcases a screenshot of the virtual camera in action. The viewﬁnder provides real-
time descriptions of the current location, and by pressing a trigger, the camera produces
as c i n t i g r a p h i cd e p i c t i o no ft h a td e s c r i p t i o n .T h ec a m e r af e a t u r e st h r e ep h y s i c a ld i a l s
that govern data and AI parameters, inﬂuencing the appearance of the image, much like
conventional cameras. It operates by utilizing an open API to gather data from location-
related information, incorporating details such as the address, weather, time of day,

88 R. Kimura and T. Nakajima
and nearby surroundings. Paragraphica amalgamates all these data points to generate
prompts that elaborate on the current location and moment. Using text-to-image AI, the
camera transforms these prompts into “photos”. The resulting “photo” is more than just
as n a p s h o t ;i ts e r v e sa sav i s u a ld a t ap o i n ta n dar e ﬂ e c t i o no ft h es p e c i ﬁ cl o c a t i o na n d ,
to some extent, how the AI model perceives the location.
In this case study, the hybrid consists of a reality generated by a generative AI. The
resulting virtual reality successfully creates a compelling experience by maintaining a
unique connection with the real world. The question of whether the world is made up
of distinct entities or interconnected relationships has been a topic of philosophical and
scientiﬁc debate for centuries. Paragraphica suggests that both perspectives hold merit
and can offer valuable insights into the nature of reality.
4.5 Discussion
Design methodologies rooted in the more-than-human perspective empower us to tran-
scend and expand our horizons beyond the conventional dualism that separates nature
from society and aligns with postpluralism. In traditional service design, human-centered
design has long been the standard, prioritizing the user’s perspective [ 33]. While these
conventional design approaches excel at improving user-friendliness and meeting the
needs of speciﬁc users, they may fall short when it comes to creating services that
extend beyond the conﬁnes of the user’s viewpoint. Moreover, focusing solely on the
user’s perspective proves inadequate for considering the numerous complexities and
contexts that extend beyond the immediate scope of the user, such as economic and
environmental factors intertwined with service provision.
Affordances, when examined from the standpoint of postpluralism, provide insights
into the complexities arising from interactions between individuals and society. The
ﬁrst case study in this section demonstrates how considering hybrids formed from the
multifaceted viewpoints and listening points of individuals can reveal new use cases.
Conversely, the second case study suggests that integrating gamiﬁcation into services
and aligning it with the affordances of hybrids can lead to more suitable and thoughtful
designs. As a result, MTHD, grounded in a postpluralist perspective, does not aim to
replace human-centered design but rather to complement it. It offers a path to explore a
broader range of possibilities and address a wider spectrum of challenges.
The next crucial aspect to consider is the inherent nature of meaning as conveyed by
affordances. In the ﬁeld of computer science, various approaches attempt to articulate
the meaning of a program, employing methods such as operational, axiomatic, and rep-
resentational semantics [ 47]. These methodologies aim to provide an explicit deﬁnition
of a program’s meaning through mathematical or similar frameworks. In this context,
it’s essential to view the meaning of affordances as a structural entity. When multiple
affordances share a common underlying structure, the possibility arises to abstractly
encapsulate these affordances and assign them a universal signiﬁcance. For example,
[28]o u t l i n e st h ea f f o r d a n c e so fad i g i t a lp l a t f o r ma sa b s t r a c te n t i t i e sp r o v i d e db yt h e
platform. Similarly, [ 25]e l u c i d a t e st h ee s s e n c eo fa f f o r d a n c e sb yn a m i n gt h o s eo f f e r e d
by digital artifacts as “virtual forms” and imbuing them with a structured framework
of value and rhetoric. Hence, in future endeavors, it becomes pivotal to deliberate on
Exploring Opportunities from the More-than-Human Perspective 89
the appropriate structure for the discourse surrounding affordances in this speciﬁc case
study.
An essential dilemma arising in these considerations concerns how to address the
scale of the hybrid. As Strathern astutely notes, real-world hybrids encompass net-
works of inﬁnite dimensions. However, contemplating an inﬁnite network is inherently
impractical [ 44]. Therefore, it becomes imperative to deliberate on the network’s bound-
aries and establish a speciﬁc cutoff point. In contrast to conventional human-centered
design methodologies, which often employ exceedingly brief network cutoffs for the
sake of simplicity in analysis, neglecting the existence of hybrids, this paper argues
that we should extend our considerations to include longer-than-usual network cutoffs.
This extended perspective is vital, especially in scenarios involving interactions among
diverse human and nonhuman elements. Debates about the appropriate length of net-
work cutoffs are currently ongoing, and we plan to explore suitable methods for deﬁning
these cutoffs in future studies, informed by various case studies involving networks of
varying lengths.
5 Conclusion
The more-than-human perspective represents a departure from traditional human-
centered design, with the potential to inject diversity and innovation into the design
process. In the future, we anticipate the integration of this perspective into both research
and practical applications to advance sustainable design and foster novel innovations. A
crucial aspect of future research involves making comparisons. Typically, quantitative
comparisons use statistical methods. However, when the objective of the comparison is
not to determine superiority but to gain fresh insights and perspectives, traditional verti-
cal comparisons based on scientiﬁc methods may not be suitable. Instead, it is essential
to approach comparisons by starting with the unique elements being compared. To facil-
itate these comparisons, one typically identiﬁes common structures or abstract elements
and then proceeds to examine the distinctions within those structures. For instance, in
[25], the authors explore how values and rhetoric can be applied to the world based
on a structured framework known as the Dimension World Model. Nevertheless, when
it proves challenging to assume the existence of a common structure, devising mean-
ingful comparisons and extracting insights from differences becomes a complex task.
In such scenarios, the more-than-human perspective can introduce novel avenues for
comparative analysis.
While traditional technologies like digital transformation (DX) and gamiﬁcation
undoubtedly offer beneﬁts in terms of efﬁciency and automation, there is an inher-
ent risk associated with overreliance on these tools. Organizations that become overly
dependent on such technologies may ﬁnd themselves becoming rigid and ill-equipped
to adapt to the ever-changing landscape [ 6]. Although algorithms can deliver consistent
outcomes and streamline processes, they also have their limitations, including the poten-
tial for erroneous decisions stemming from data inaccuracies [ 2]. Hence, organizations
must strike a delicate balance between leveraging algorithms and embracing technology
while preserving ﬂexibility. The danger of over-reliance on algorithms is that it can stiﬂe
adaptability, jeopardizing an organization’s competitive edge and market relevance. In

importance, as a failure to exhibit these qualities increases the likelihood of an organiza-
tion falling behind. Therefore, achieving harmony between algorithms and the organiza-
tion is imperative. Algorithms can undoubtedly enhance efﬁciency and automation, but
concurrently, organizations must safeguard creativity, maintain sound decision-making
processes, and uphold ﬂexibility. This task poses a signiﬁcant challenge, necessitating
organizations to adopt a strategic approach to technology adoption. They should leverage
the more-than-human perspective to unlock maximum value through human-machine
collaboration.
