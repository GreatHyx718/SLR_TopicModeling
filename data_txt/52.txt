Abstract
This paper explores the ethical, social, political, and philosophical
implications of generative AI (GenAI) on human creativity, con-
tributing to the current discussions on the impact of AI. We use
speculative and critical design as our approach to avoid abstract
guesswork and provide more nuanced and concrete insights into the
matter at hand. We conducted five speculative design workshops
centered on Infinity Book, a fictional system capable of generating
any kind of literary work. Participants used brainwriting, the Fu-
ture Ripples method, and dialogue-labs to explore potential futures
and socio-material impacts of such technology. Reflexive Thematic
Analysis was employed to analyze the results from the workshops,
and we developed twelve design fictions that illustrate diverse uses
and societal implications of GenAI. Based on these results, we for-
mulated three strong concepts, Authenticity, Creative Agency, and
Liveness, that link concrete design considerations with broader
philosophical discussions.

The boundaries between technology and humanity are becoming
increasingly blurred. Technologies from advanced artificial intel-
ligence to virtual reality and neural implants are expanding and
complicating human-technology relations [ 38]. Generative Artifi-
cial Intelligence (GenAI) is one such computational technology that
has recently attracted massive public interest. GenAI refers to a
set of machine learning (ML) systems that are trained on massive
amounts of existing content and are capable of generating new,
plausible content (e.g., images, texts, music, code, and other forms
of media), usually responding to textual or visual prompts [ 83,104].
The advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-
4, Gemini, Bard, and other transformer-based deep neural networks
facilitated a surge in GenAI systems during the 2020s. In 2020,
GPT-3 was already reported to demonstrate the ability to produce
non-fictional work that can hardly be distinguished from human
work [ 35]. Since then, numerous studies have evaluated GenAI’s
ability to facilitate automatic literary creation, with varying results
[21, 41, 52, 82, 92, 112].
We are still far from using GenAI to write consistent artistic
literary works automatically, however this may change in the next
five years or so. The world is witnessing the emergence of funda-
mental questions regarding the relationship between humans and
machines, such as the value of human creativity and the cultural
significance of creative work. It is crucial to foster reflective and
critical engagement with both the current state and how things
could be in the future [95].
Despite extensive (and exploding) research on GenAI, this reflec-
tive and critical engagement remains fairly unexplored. Liu et al.
[72], for example, have argued that much of the current literature is
focused on technology development or fairly obvious and unques-
tioned use cases and that the critical discussions tend to remain
abstract, painting vague utopias or dystopias of how GenAI will
change the world in the near future. This implies that there is space
for concrete speculations that are still critical and reflective enough
to enable informed insights into the impact of such technologies.
These considerations lead us to embark on critical speculations
on advanced GenAI-based systems capable of automated literary
creation, exploring their impact on creative practices and their
influence on the socio-material world. As a starting point, we came
up with the idea of Infinity Book (IB) , which is a fictional system that
can generate all kinds of literary works, e.g., novels, short stories,
1430

and poems. We used infinity Book as a conceptual anchor point
for our critical speculations in the form of a series of speculative
design workshops and the creation of a set of design fictions. In
this paper, we report the results of these speculations.
The direct inspiration for Infinity Book comes from the great
science-fiction writer Stanislav Lem’s short story First Sally (A)
or Trurl’s Electronic Bard , first published in Polish in 1965 as part
of his Cyberiada collection. The story depicts the development
and consequences of a machine (the eponymous electronic bard)
capable of producing vast amounts of poems exploring all kinds of
themes and fitting every situation. Roald Dahl’s 1953 short story
The Great Automatic Grammatizator and the concept of an infinite
library, as explored by various authors, including Jorge Luis Borges,
Terry Pratchett, and Umberto Eco, provided further inspiration for
the project.
Additional motivations emerged from considering the signif-
icant role of books as a prevalent form of literary expression in
contemporary cultures. Books are valued for their ability to capture,
transmit, and preserve culturally important information, making
them key tools in maintaining and sharing knowledge across gen-
erations. Compared to other cultural forms, books are often seen
as stable cultural artifacts, with high literature especially receiv-
ing considerable cultural appreciation. Reading books demands a
level of engagement that is distinct from other media, requiring
extended periods of focused attention. This deep engagement is
thought to foster a unique connection between the author and the
reader. Similar patterns of focused engagement in books, movies,
and video games suggest that these speculations also apply to these
other media forms. Current trends indicate that fully AI-generated
fiction books are likely to emerge before, for example, AI-generated
movies, making these predictions more timely. It should be noted
that for the purposes of this study, we have taken a fairly liberal
view on what is considered a book [ 13,63]. This paper reports the
results of three speculative design workshops and two dialogue-labs
sessions with creative writers around the critical envisioning of
Infinity Book to answer the following research questions:
•How do systems automating literary creation shape the so-
ciomaterial world and human-technology relationships?
•What overall interaction design concerns arise for such sys-
tems?
The contributions of this paper include ten themes arising from
the workshops speculating on the impact of Infinity Book and twelve
design fiction scenarios illustrating some of the key issues. Based
on these, we present three design considerations, Authenticity,
Creative Agency, and Liveness, framed as strong concepts [55]. These
results provide new insights and perspectives on the futures of
automated literary creation. Additionally, the studies included in
the paper refine and combine existing speculative design methods
while foregrounding posthumanist perspectives on creativity and
generative AI.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. First, we review
relevant related work, and introduce our methodology. Then, we de-
scribe and present the results of three speculative design workshops
(n=19) and two dialogue-labs sessions (n=18). Finally, we present
12 resulting design fiction scenarios, followed by a discussion of
potential design considerations and conclusions.2 Background
2.1 Automated and Algorithmic Literary
Creation
The idea of writing machines has existed longer than the afore-
mentioned Lem’s and Dahl’s “design fictions.” Sharples and Pérez
[100] in their Story Machines mention a machine capable of writing
books with little human effort appearing in Jonathan Swift’s Gul-
liver’s Travels 1726 and a steam-powered automatic prose writer
in Sir Walter Scott’s Tales of the Crusaders from 1825. Experiments
in combinatory poetry and literature have even deeper historical
roots, including, for example, Lady Su Hui’s Star Gauge poem1
from 4th century China, capable of producing over 3000 shorter po-
ems, Ramon LLull’s Ars Generalis Ultima andArs Brevis in the 13th
century, and John Peter’s 1677 booklet on artificial versifying [ 90].
More recent examples include Queneau’s Cent Mille Milliards de
Poèmes , which consists of 10 sonnets, each split into 14 strips. These
strips can be combined in any order, thus capable of creating 1014
different sonnets. For actual machines capable of verse generation,
John Clark’s Eureka machine from 1845 century is a notable early
example [ 100]. The advent of computers after World War II enabled
further experimentation. Christopher Strachey wrote a program
capable of creating Victorian love letters on the Manchester Mark
1 in 19522. Poems were thus the first to get automated and have
remained an active topic ever since [71].
According to Ryan [ 98], the first computer story generators
were developed at the beginning of the 1960s. Joseph Grimes pro-
grammed an IBM 650 mainframe computer in 1960-1961 to generate
fairy tales based on Vladimir Propp’s model of Russian folktales,
while the SAGA II system from 1960 could reportedly generate
screenplays for western genre TV series. Klein’s Automatic Novel
Writer, first reported in 1971, wrote somewhat passable murder
mysteries, albeit only minor variations of basically the same story.
Other attempts at automated story generation include Tale-Spin
[81], Universe storytelling system [ 66], Brutus [ 16], and Fabula [ 97].
The field of automated story generation, especially for interactive
digital narratives and games [ 40], has grown steadily over the last
few decades.
The rise of GenAI, especially powerful LLMs, has given the field
an additional boost with hundreds of research prototype projects
going on in both academia [ 31] and hobbyist communities, such
as Hugging Face [ 20], an ever-increasing number of commercial
AI-assisted creative writing platforms (e.g., Jasper, Rytr, Sudowrite),
and the rise of published LLM authored books [ 17]. The debate
on how people perceive and react to AI-generated artworks and
what is the value of such works has become active, even heated,
during the current GenAI boom. Besides any critics and creative
industry workers denying the cultural significance GenAI art, re-
cent studies have indicated that the attitudes of both experts and
non-experts are shifting. Hitsuwari et al [ 52], for example, found
out that the participants in their study could not distinguish be-
tween human-written and AI-generated haiku poetry. Similarly,
Porter and Machery [ 92] reported that non-experts were unable
to determine whether a poem was written by humans or AI. The

participants even rated the AI-generated poetry higher. Hong et
al. [53] study in 2019 indicated that the participants judged the
artistic value of AI-generated works as lower. However, in a more
recent study van Hees et al. [ 108] report that the participants rated
AI-created (OpenAI Dall-E 2) art higher than human artworks. They
also speculate that there is a shift in attitudes and preferences to-
wards AI-images. Currently, GenAI cannot match human levels
of quality in artworks requiring prolonged engagement, such as
novels, but it is conceivable that similar evaluations will be possi-
ble in the near future. These shifting cultural values indicate that
there is a need for speculating on the wider societal and cultural
implications of GenAI.
2.2 Generative AI in Creative Activities
Thanks to their generative capabilities, the use of generative AI in
creative activities has emerged as an important topic in the field
of Creativity and HCI [ 67,99,101]. Instead of mere automation
done by AI, the major approach has been that humans and AI co-
create. For example, previous studies have shown how creative
practitioners can work with LLMs or text-to-image generation
models in diverse fields, such as story writing [ 21,41,70,94,120],
fashion design [58], and painting, drawing, and visual arts [19, 23,
121]. Additionally, there is a fast-growing body of work using AI in
co- and participatory design approaches in many different domains
(e.g., specifically, GenAI’s competence in swiftly generating a larger
spectrum of ideas has been exploited to inspire people to create
more original and useful ones compared to working alone [ 2,73].
Still, despite the benefits of AI, how the human-AI co-creativity will
be shaped in the future remains an open question. For example, in
the exercise of measuring creativity in divergent thinking, Koivisto
and Grassini [ 61] found that humans outperform AI in generating
more diverse ideas, which indicates that the practice of building on
AI-generated content could eventually limit human creativity. Liu
et al. [ 74] also show that delayed responses from AI give marginal
time for humans to reflect and develop more creative ideas, which
suggests that the inherent human abilities cannot be overlooked in
human-AI co-creation. Likewise, we believe that envisioning future
human-AI co-creation should be grounded in AI’s competence and
understanding of how creative practitioners work and perceive
working with generative AI [105, 116].
2.3 Speculative Design With and About
Generative AI
Using GenAI tools in speculative design, especially in design fiction,
has gained attention during the recent boom. Blythe [ 11], for exam-
ple, argues that even though the "raw" outputs from GenAI tools
such as ChatGPT and image generators tend to remain plain and
conventional, the tools can prove useful for design fictions with crit-
ical prompting. Similarly, many others have reported their experi-
ences in using generative AI in speculative design, e.g., [ 65,102,118]
while Østvold Ek et al . [87] gives a partial review of the relationship
between AI and speculative design. Much closer to our approach
is speculative and critical design about GenAI. Lin and Long [ 69]
present two speculative design scenarios of future GenAI tools
and suggest environment, data privacy, embodiment andplay as
preliminary themes for design concerns in this field. Friedrich [ 39]used design workshops and interviews with artists to come up with
future scenarios of AI’s relation and implications to art and society.
The workshops generated four speculative scenarios (The AI Muse,
The Creature Generator, The No-AI Commune, The AI-enhanced
Film) expressed as short stories with visualizations created with
Stable Diffusion 3. Popova [91] similarly used workshops with de-
signers to create design fictions on how generative AI tools could
integrate into their workflows. The final resulting design fiction
takes the form of a user manual for such an AI tool giving details of
four specific use cases of a fictional Enterprise Generative Ideator
(EGI) system. Yan [ 119] focuses on a more specific aspect of creative
GenAI use, namely the generation of memes.
3 Methodology
We used several approaches to speculate on the future of automated
literary creation. Overall, the study consisted of four phases: (1)
three speculative and critical design workshops, (2) two dialogue-
labs sessions, (3) development of design fiction scenarios, and fi-
nally, (4) formulation of strong concepts. To foster in-depth specu-
lation, we designed the workshops based on three philosophical ap-
proaches: Actor-Network Theory, postphenomenology, and more-
than-human design. We used Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA)
to analyze the results from the workshops and the dialogue-labs
sessions. Applying these diverse methods and approaches enabled
us to gain new perspectives and a wider understanding of the is-
sues at hand, which we formulated into three strong concepts. The
summary of approaches is shown in Figure 1.
3.1 Speculative and Critical Design
We employed speculative and critical design as they can enable
envisioning the future of technology by speculating on its current
state in our society. Speculative design [ 3,28] is a method of paint-
ing a picture of potential futures; it explores hypotheticals of how
the design would mold, transform, and reset the parameters of
our world; it transcends the confines of present-day technologi-
cal and cultural possibilities, influencing the trajectory of future
technological advancements. Similarly, critical design [ 27,78] chal-
lenges dominant paradigms by creating artifacts that critique so-
cietal norms, values, or technological trends. It seeks to resolve
assumptions by offering designs that highlight contradictions, ethi-
cal concerns, or unintended consequences. In other words, critical
design not only seamlessly fits artifacts into our world [ 6], it also
poses challenges, questions assumptions, and offers a critique, thus
presenting alternative perspectives and scenarios that highlight the
issues, contradictions, or problems with current practices. Together,
speculative and critical design can foster reflective engagement
not just with what and how things are at present but with what
could be developed in the future [ 95]. This critical engagement aims
to carefully explore the intended, and especially the unintended,
consequences of introducing newly designed objects, systems, and
assemblages to our lives3.

Figure 1: We explored the future of co-writing with AI in two studies (blue boxes). Each study consists of a series of workshops,
employing philosophical exploration methods that enable novel speculation on the relationship between human and AI (pink
box). We analyzed the combined results of studies using Reflexive Thematic Analysis and synthesized design fiction scenarios
(yellow box) and strong concepts (orange box), addressing our research questions respectively. Section numbers for each part
are shown in parentheses.
These approaches are often combined with design fiction [ 10,
103], a narrative-driven approach that uses fictional scenarios, arti-
facts, and stories to explore potential futures. Situating design fic-
tions within critical design can be used to provoke reflection about
the implications of emerging technologies and societal trends. The
approach blends elements of design, storytelling, and speculative
thinking to imagine "what if" scenarios, focusing on possibilities
rather than predictions. Design fictions can take many different
shapes and forms from short stories through fictional user manuals
to even videogames [ 25]. In this study, we used storyboarding [ 106]
to illustrate the envisioned design fictions.
3.2 Philosophical Approaches
The philosophical theories supporting this study are Actor-Network
Theory (ANT), Postphenomenology, and the posthumanist-inspired,
More Than Human-Centered Perspective (which we introduce in
the next subsection). ANT is about removing humans from the
center of the show by introducing non-human actors , such as ob-
jects, technology, processes, and even ideologies and beliefs, in the
analysis on the same level as humans [ 1]. ANT originally arose
from the science and technology studies of the second half of the
20th century [ 64]. Lately, ANT has been increasingly used to under-
stand technological developments in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) [ 38]. The focus is also on the ever-shifting relations between
these human and nonhuman actors and, as the name implies, these
relationships form networks of influence and effect [1].
Postphenomenology analyses the relationship between technol-
ogy, humans, and the world in a philosophical way. Instead of
inquiring about the capabilities of technology for users, postphe-
nomenology assumes technology plays a proactive role in mediat-
ing interactions between humans and the world. This aligns well
with our research aims of determining how the structure of human-
technology-world relations will change under the mediation of
GenAI. In particular, we analyze the data collected from the work-
shops through four relationships (Embodied, Alterity, Hermeneutic,
Background) proposed by Ihde [ 57] with additional two relations
(Cyborg, Augmentation) proposed by Verbeek [ 110]: Apart fromthe structure of human-technology-world relations at play, this
work explores the implications of mediation. Postphenomenology
helps figure out how technology co-constitutes our relation to the
socio-material world and how this relation shapes us, which implies
ethicopolitical considerations in designing technological artifacts.
3.3 More than Human
More than human-centered design describes the design space where
both humans and nonhumans are at the center of thought and ac-
tion and interconnect materially, ethically, and existentially [ 111].
It does not refute the entirety of traditional human-centered design
(HCD), but instead brings nonhuman actants into design considera-
tions in a way that previous design thinking did not. From the more
than human perspective, HCI research has gone through “three
waves” ever since its emergence [ 12]. The first wave put forward the
idea that human-machine interactions should be optimized with
regard to usability. The second wave stood for human-centered
design with an endeavor to measure the interactions through un-
quantifiable features such as “efficiency” and “uncertainty”. Finally,
the third one recognized the ubiquitous presence of technology
across social environments, thereby situating interactions in the
messy, complex world. In the third wave, the world has begun to
appear networked by pervasive technology. The performative rela-
tionship between humans and technology has become so entangled
that user-centered design practices have ceased to be useful [ 38].
Design must acknowledge its exploitation of nonhuman species
and the materials we extract for human use [111].
Hayles’s "cognitive assemblage" [ 45] explores such relationships
between human and non-human cognition. Cognitive assemblages
are used to understand how different kinds of cognitive agents
interact and form networks that generate knowledge, meaning, and
agency. The concept challenges the idea that cognition is solely a hu-
man characteristic. Instead, she argues that cognition is distributed
across different entities, both human (individuals and social groups)
and non-human (computers, algorithms, and networks). These dif-
ferent cognitive agents interact and form assemblages of distributed
cognition. Hayles also distinguishes between conscious thought,
1433
Infinity Book: Speculating Literary Expressions in the Age of Generative AI DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
which is traditionally attributed only to humans, and nonconscious
cognition [ 46]. Nonconscious cognition refers to processes that hap-
pen without conscious awareness but still contribute to cognitive
functions in the assemblages. The nonconscious functions can, and
often do, involve nonhuman entities. This includes how AI algo-
rithms process data and generate outputs in GenAI systems. The
approaches above provide frameworks for reconceptualizing design,
moving beyond anthropocentric perspectives. These informed the
design of the workshops, particularly the first three, and provided
the philosophical grounding for interpreting the results.
3.4 Strong Concepts
Höök and Löwgren’s strong concepts [ 55] are characterized by their
ability to be transferable across different contexts while retaining
their identity and relevance, thus offering a framework for creating
and analyzing interaction designs. Strong concepts are distinct from
highly contextualized design exemplars and abstract universal prin-
ciples found in theories, and operate in the middle ground, offering
designers a way to articulate recurring patterns or approaches that
address common design challenges. For instance, a strong concept
might encapsulate ideas like seamfulness [22],civic learning [44],
orsomaesthetic appreciation [54], providing a reusable lens through
which design decisions can be informed and evaluated. In short,
strong concepts are not prescriptive but open-ended and genera-
tive, enabling designers to adapt them to specific projects while still
drawing on their core insights. This flexibility makes them particu-
larly useful in speculative and critical design practices, where the
aim is often to provoke thought and challenge assumptions rather
than deliver solutions.
We followed the principle of developing strong concepts to dis-
cuss three themes about human-AI relationships from our work-
shops (Section 7). Strong concepts are constructed by identifying
their source in various design instances (e.g., an existing or future
use scenario, a theoretical perspective on human behavior). The key
is to analyze these design instances and distill elements or principles
that could hold value across different design situations or domains.
The next steps, horizontal and vertical grounding, involve situating
the strong concept within existing academic work and connecting
it to other similar concepts and relevant frameworks. This process
involves examining whether the concept appears in other contexts,
analyzing its broader empirical base, and linking it to theories that
can enhance its explanatory power. Finally, constructing strong
concepts involves triangulating these empirical, analytical, and
theoretical insights. Through these steps, we synthesized strong
concepts that fuse isolated materials from the workshops and design
fiction into transferable design knowledge contributions.
4 Study 1: Speculative Design Workshops
4.1 Aims and Motivation
We first conducted three speculative design workshops between
December 2023 and February 2024. We introduced the concept of
Infinity Book , a future fictional system powered by GenAI, and used
it as a conceptual tool to facilitate the workshops. The aim of these
workshops was to get a broader understanding of possible char-
acteristics, use cases, and impacts of the system. The participants
were encouraged to imagine many different futures and possibilitieswithout paying much attention to the plausibility or feasibility at
this stage. Preliminary results from study 1 are reported in [56].
4.2 Participants
A total of 19 participants (7 self-identifying as women and 12 as
men) took part in three workshops. Participants varied in their
occupation (11 doctoral students with design backgrounds, 5 de-
signers, 2 artists, 1 professor) and experience with GenAI tools. The
participants were recruited using snowball sampling, starting from
the first author’s contacts. The main criteria for participation were
familiarity with interaction design and interest in GenAI.
4.3 Procedure: Workshop I
Workshop I followed three steps and took 3 hours. The host first
introduced the concepts of Infinity Book , Speculative Design, and
More-than-human Design. In the second step, the participants used
6-3-5 Brainwriting for ideating diverse "actors" involved in Infinity
Book system. Actors, according to Actor-Network Theory [ 64], can
be human and nonhuman and always have relations with other
actors. For example, an actor can be someone or something that
uses the system, benefits from the system, exploits or is exploited
by the system, and so on. Participants were asked to use a couple
of sentences to describe the actors and their relations to Infinity
Book and other actors in a concrete manner. The workflow of 6-3-5
Brainwriting worked as follows: During each 5-minute round, each
participant was required to write down 3 ideas on 3 sticky notes and
put them on their sheet in a row. After each 5-minute round (the
facilitator shouted “Switch!”), every participant gave their sheet to
the next person, and a new round would start. After all 6 rounds, a
total of 126 (3 ideas in 6 rounds with 7 people) ideas were gathered.
The last step was to organize ideas using an affinity diagram [ 75].
The participants systematically went through each note one by one.
They then grouped notes that expressed similar ideas, placing them
on the whiteboard. Each group was given a name, and this process
was iterated until all the notes had been organized.
4.4 Procedure: Workshops II and III
Similar to workshop I, workshops II and III started with a brief in-
troduction to Infinity Book and Speculative Design. Each workshop
took 3 hours. The main workshop component was the three ideation
sessions using the “Future Ripples” method [ 30], a strategic fore-
sight approach based on the Futures Wheel method [ 42] that offers
a more dynamic and speculative process for ideating consequences
and impacts. It starts with a “what if” scenario for creating ripples
of consequences. For the two workshops, the “what if” scenarios
were predefined by the researchers, which are "What if there were
systems widely available that can produce full-length novels from
scratch according to users’ wishes?" and"What if there were systems
that could create any kind of fictional text, e.g., novels, poems, short
stories, self-help manuals, and so on, from scratch?" accordingly. In
the first ideation session, each participant had 15 minutes to think
independently about the consequences of the “what if” pebble and
write them down on sticky notes, with one consequence per note.
Then everyone presented their best two to three consequences,
placing them on the whiteboard. After discussing within the group,
participants drew lines between sticky notes on the board if one

Table 1: The resulting themes (T) from RTA and representative quotes from the speculative design workshops (WS) in Study 1.
(T1) Revaluation of labor Besides creating works of literature, the system
was imagined to communicate with and analyze humans, provide
psychotherapy, generate new belief systems, and even participate in human
politics. Humans will lose certain jobs because machines can do the same and
probably even better."People lose jobs->the creativity Industry the writing
Industry->writer’s job disappear." [WS2]
"Neoliberalism becomes dead in literature. People only
write novels for pleasure or to push boundaries of
literature." [WS2]
(T2) Redefining creativity and imagination Another often discussed
issue was the impact on human creativity due to overreliance on the system.
With the rise of AI creativity, it is hard to clearly define what humans and
machines can and cannot create. Some even worried that humans will
gradually and unconsciously lose the capabilities and skills for proper
imagination."Creativity station: an area for people to increase
creativity because overreliance on the Infinity Book may
make them lose the ability to think critically and
independently." [WS1]
"Literary expression becomes influenced by AI’s
creativity, which might bring about new forms of literary
critics/creation." [WS2]
(T3) Fragmentations and divisions Other concerns include the increasing
physical, interpersonal, and even cultural isolation due to the massive
increase in the availability and reliance on personalized content as
manifested by a decrease in empathy, increasing narcissism, and even a rise
in digital addiction. This further isolation can also lead to the loss of shared
creative artifacts that act as cultural reference points, potentially further
fragmenting the socio-cultural fields."If all content is custom made to every individual,
people’s relationship will deteriorate and cultural
divisions will increase due to a lack of shared languages."
[WS3]
"The available access to such services with money raise
in a crazy manner become new class discrimination
division and hierarchical depression." [WS2]
(T4) Content pollution and control The massive and constant content
supply can exacerbate “information pollution” and the proliferation of fakes,
eroding trust and the sense of authenticity."The whole Internet dominated by AIGC. Languages are
greatly reshaped." [WS2]
"Content is cheap. Actual literature is expensive. Massive

and “pure” humanity. In this newly found appreciation of live human
performances, participants emphasized the need to protect human creativity
and that humans will still crave real and physical human connection."Young people, students are interested in non-digital

was the consequence of another. In the second and third ideation
sessions, participants were inspired by existing consequences on
the board, repeating the exercise.
4.5 Analysis
To capture the relationship among them, we photographed the
generated notes from all the workshops on the original whiteboard.
We also moved them to white A4 sheets, preserving their original
layout, to closely analyze them.
We conducted Reflexive Thematic Analysis (RTA) [ 14] to ana-
lyze the materials from the three workshops. The themes generated
through RTA are creative interpretations that narrate the stories
of the data. Themes are not born with the data, waiting for the
researchers to discover, nor are they singular or fixed. Instead, they
vary based on the researcher’s theoretical insights and analytical
skills [ 15]. Consequently, producing theory-driven results makes
RTA particularly appropriate for our study as we aim to use the
above-mentioned philosophical approaches to inform our analy-
sis. The resulting themes and representative quotes are shown in
Table 1. We present the quotes with the workshop number as the
workshop format encouraged sharing and non-ownership of ideas.
5 Study 2: Dialogue-labs Sessions
Dialogue-labs [77] are primarily used in the middle stages of the de-
sign process to support researchers and designers in creating ideasand concepts for future designs, together with relevant stakehold-
ers and end users. It combines different methods and techniques,
providing a structured way of generating ideas through a sequence
of co-design activities. Its main focus is on three key structuring
aspects: the process of how dialogue-labs sessions are orchestrated,
the space in which the sessions unfold, and the materials that are
employed. Dialogue-labs have been successfully applied in a wide
range of projects to involve different participants including HCI
researchers [ 43], children with ADHD [ 33], or animals [ 51], and
for different purposes such as to encourage interaction between
nearby strangers [ 88], to incorporate African perspectives in the
design and development of drones [ 117], and to explore how older
adults in South America might prefer to interact with their personal
health data [18].
5.1 Aims and Motivation
Based on the findings from the previous workshops, two dialogue-
labs[77] sessions were organized at School of Creative Media, City
University of Hong Kong in June 2024, which consisted of co-design
activities to explore creative writers’ perceptions of AI, including
their dreams, fears, and aspirations in relation to their future pro-
fessional practice. Three members of the research team took on a
dual facilitator/participant role by encouraging an open discussion
that would allow novel perspectives to flourish. The dialogue-labs
sessions were documented by means of still photography and were
video recorded for later analysis.

5.2 Participants
A total of 18 participants (6 self-identifying as women and 12 as
men) took part in the two dialogue-labs sessions. We again used
snowball sampling, starting with the first author’s local connections.
The participants had to be either professional creative writers or
HCI researchers/practitioners. Each session had nine participants
who worked in three trios (one woman per trio). Each trio (Figure
2a) included at least one professional creative writer and one HCI
researcher. The professional creative writers had at least 13 years of
experience each. The HCI researchers and practitioners were from
a range of backgrounds: 6 had extensive experience in interaction
design, with 4 of them in co-design, and 2 had a background in
interactive media art. Each had at least 4 years of experience in
HCI. Additionally, 4 PhD students with backgrounds in HCI and
creative media participated in the first session.
5.3 Materials
Six locations were provided with a range of building materials and
inspiration props (Fig. 2b), helping participants to build a common
design language and providing them with different entry points
to the design problem. Each location included a different activity,
which fostered creativity by drawing on different thinking and
doing skills. Each activity was a combination of a taskand materials,
and each combination was meant to investigate novel AI literary
art forms. The activities were presented and described as follows:
5.3.1 Reader’s Confession Booth (Sketch). Readers often engage
with books based on personal experiences and emotions. Under-
standing how reading contexts affect interpretation can enrich the
reading experience. You will be sharing personal stories and recent
life events that might influence your reading mood. Individually
describe your favourite/weirdest/most embarrassing reading experi-
ence. After sharing each other’s stories, discuss how those contexts
influenced your interpretations.
5.3.2 Don’t Feed the AI (Collage—Fig. 2c). The input provided to
Generative AI can significantly influence the output, revealing the
interplay between input and creation. Different input types like
news articles, personal photos and anecdotes as well as explicit
prompts can be used to start and influence AI-generated texts. Usethe images available on the table to explore which types of inspiration
AI can use to create stories.
5.3.3 Story Strategy Studio (PLEX Cards [ 76]).Storytelling forms
and strategies shape how a narrative is perceived and understood,
offering various ways to engage the audience. Consider diverse
literary forms (e.g., haiku, novel, epic poetry, flash fiction) and
discuss their effects on narrative engagement. Shuffle the PLEX
cards deck. Randomly pick three cards each. Take turns describing
what new playful literary forms AI could support by placing down a
PLEX card at a time.
5.3.4 What’s AI got to do with it? (Diagram). Co-creativity between
humans and AI can lead to innovative literary forms and narratives,
blending human imagination with AI capabilities. Reflect on past
collaborative experiences and the value of co-creation. Explore the
diagram on the table with different roles the AI could take in the
context of the collaborative process. Discuss how you envision the
AI-human partnership could unfold in the case of Infinity Book.
5.3.5 Roleplay Realm (Lego + AI—Fig. 2a). Roleplay allows people
to immerse themselves in different characters and perspectives, en-
hancing empathy and creative expression. Each participant adopts
a Lego character and engages in a roleplay dialogue facilitated by
the AI. Use the ChatGPT interface on the laptop and ask it to create
dialogue for your character. Then reflect on how embodying different
characters influenced your understanding of the Infinity Book.
5.3.6 Worldbuilders’ Corner (Writing). Worldbuilding is crucial
in creating immersive and believable fictional universes. Explore
elements of worldbuilding such as geography, culture, politics, and
history, and discuss how these elements contribute to the depth and
richness of a story. Write a less than 100-word flash fiction, which
creates an as rich as possible fictional world where the Infinity Book
system has been in everyday use for a long time.
5.4 Procedure
Each dialogue-labs session lasted two hours and was divided into
the following segments:

Table 2: The resulting themes (T) from RTA of the dialogue-lab results in Study 2.
(T6) AI as an Expression Formulator The participants envisioned
the opportunities for AI playing a supportive role in making vague
emotional expressions concrete and exploring novel combinations of
sensory perceptions to highlight novel expressions.“Not everyone is good at expressing their feelings, so AI can mix
creative expressions we said before to help you express and
share your feelings. . . . AI could say ‘you know, this is the way
you write this’.” [P11]
(T7) Personalized Fiction One commonly discussed future among
the participants was where AI continuously follows individuals to
provide personalized stories. In such a society, it could be possible
that AI is more aware of a user’s profile, similar to how current AI
recommendation systems provide personalized content to users.“What is literature for if it’s just for one person?” [P18]
“At a smaller scale, you don’t get that connection to another
person: ‘Oh, I read this book!’ ‘I haven’t read it because it’s only
yours.’ But if you share it [...]” [P17]
(T8) Embodied Meaning The participants discussed the
fundamental challenge in training AI to have a similar level of sensory
perception as humans. It is difficult for people to capture and describe
their sensations, and writing heavily relies on a writer’s embodied life
experiences.“The AI cannot create human stories because it does not
experience as a human. You cannot have an AI that is more
traumatized than another AI.” [P11]
"Other input modalities than just vision and text or audio, how
to incorporate touch, texture, smell (to AI), the peculiar feeling
you get in your ears when its extremely humid and hot here in
<Asian City>.” [P1]
(T9) Background Relations Rather than relying on human-initiated
prompts, the machines could autonomously seek data from the
environment without humans being necessarily involved in the
process at all.“How important are we towards creation? Could it still create
something without direct human input?” [P14]
(T10) Agency and Authenticity Despite the increasing automation,
humans should still retain some agency, particularly through feedback
mechanisms. By valuing and ranking texts or other AI-generated
outputs, humans can influence the system’s direction, albeit within
limits. However, as AI systems increasingly rely on other AIs for
critique and evaluation, there is a risk that human perspectives will be
further marginalized.“So in this case, for example, then the human doesn’t even
necessarily know that these A!s are collaborating.” [P16]
“So you need to really understand context of where you are and
your time and place in history and all things at all at the same
time. [...] Yeah, interesting to see if you can actually automate
that.” [P17]
5.4.1 Introduction (15 minutes). The facilitators welcomed the par-
ticipants and led them through an informed consent process. Facili-
tators explained the main purpose of the session in a comfortable
and relaxed atmosphere to enable creativity. Participants were pre-
sented with slides generally introducing the idea of the Infinity Book ,
findings from previous workshops, and the main goal of exploring
novel literary art forms solely generated by AIs (particularly by
LLMs).
5.4.2 Co-design Rounds in Trios (3x15 minutes). Participants were
grouped into smaller trios that ensured diversity (i.e., gender, back-
ground, expertise). Each trio freely chose and spent 15 minutes
in each of three out of the six available locations (later explained
under Materials).
5.4.3 Idea Sharing (15 minutes). After a five-minute coffee break,
all participants gathered as a single group. Taking turns, each trio
shared ideas generated or interesting discussion topics at each
location. At any time, the larger group was invited to react and
build upon the idea or topic being presented.
5.4.4 Group Co-Design and Debriefing (45 minutes). All partici-
pants engaged in a longer group co-design session where previous
ideas or topics presented were further elaborated on, sometimes
resulting in new idea explorations or deeper discussions. Similar
to Google Design Sprint [ 59], the group co-design segment of the
dialogue-labs method is followed by voting for the ideas that havemore potential. However, we decided not to include this part in our
design space reflection since our goal was to more broadly discuss
professional creative writers’ perceptions of AI. Finally, the research
team thanked the participants for their time and participation. No
compensation was otherwise provided.
5.5 Analysis
We again used reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) to analyze the
results of the two dialogue-labs sessions. Using a digital affinity
diagram [ 75] on a Miro board, one researcher who had not been
present in the sessions first went through the video recordings and
created clusters. The three other researchers who had facilitated
and participated in the dialogue-labs sessions then followed a simi-
lar procedure independently. The themes are described in Table 2.
6 Design Fiction Scenarios
The first and fourth authors used the outputs from the workshops as
inspiration to create 12 design fiction scenarios illustrating different
aspects of Infinity Book . The ideas emerging from the speculative
design workshops tend to be abstract, complex, and even outlandish.
We used storyboards to help bridge the gap between these ideas
and tangible representations. The fourth author was responsible for
the initial ideas and scripts and the final storyboard composition,
while the first author provided additional ideas and comments on

specific use cases focused on individual users to broader societal
shifts. The length of the storyboards ranged from six to 46 panels,with a total of 38 pages. The storyboards, as they represent con-
crete situations, are also intended to stimulate further speculations.

7 Design Concerns as Strong Concepts
While there was some overlap between the results from the differ-
ent workshops, each workshop’s specific methods and focal areas
ensured that new concepts, perspectives, and ideas emerged. The
ensuing design fictions, including their creative process, prompted
further reflections on the research questions, especially aided by
the posthumanist and more-than-human centric approaches. The
workshop materials and the design fictions are fertile ground for
further speculations, especially focusing on areas such as privacy,
censorship, copyright and ownership, and cultural sensitivities.
Here, we discuss just three concerns related to designing and de-
ploying systems such as Infinity Book while we fully acknowledge
that there are many more such concerns in this area. We frame
these three concerns - Authenticity, Creative Agency, and Liveness
- as interrelated, and sometimes conflicting, strong concepts [55].
7.1 Authenticity
The question of the authenticity of the AI-created works emerged
in all of the workshops and is reflected in themes T2, T4, T5, T8,
and 10. Scenarios S2, S3, S5, S6, and S11 partly respond to consider-
ations of authenticity. Authenticity as a concept is, unsurprisingly,
a complex and contested one [ 85]. Dutton’s [ 29] notions of nominal
andexpressive authenticity , together with Benjamin’s [ 9] concept
ofaura, resonate with the results from the workshops. According
to Dutton, expressive authenticity refers to the work of art being
a “true expression of an individual’s or society’s values or beliefs”
[29]. Thus, a literary work can be considered authentic when it
reflects the author’s true voice, thoughts, and feelings, avoiding
pretense or artificiality. This sincerity allows the work to resonate
with readers, as it conveys genuine human experiences and emo-
tions. Authenticity involves an author staying true to their creative
vision and intentions, even if that means resisting external pres-
sures, such as market trends or ideological conformity. Nominal
authenticity, conversely, pertains to the correct origin, provenance,
or authorship of the work. Benjamin argues in his The Work of Art
in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction that the authenticity of an
artwork is closely linked to the existence of an original work of art[9]. The aura thus refers to the unique presence, authenticity, and
authority of an artwork that emanates from its originality and ties
to a specific time, place, and context. Just as Benjamin associates the
aura with an artwork’s originality, the authority and individuality
of an author are often viewed as lending a text its originality and
authenticity. The author’s intent, historical context, and personal
signature (both literal and metaphorical) contribute to the unique-
ness of the text. The aura of a literary work also relates to its ability
to inspire reverence, a sense of the sacred, or exclusivity due to its
link to the author’s creative genius. Thus, the aura can surface in
the cult of personality surrounding famous authors. Figures like
James Joyce or Virginia Woolf maintain an aura, in addition to their
works, through their iconic status, biographies, and the exclusivity
of understanding their texts. AI literature created by models trained
by famous authors might retain parts of this authenticity (S3, S5). A
similar contagion of authenticity [ 85] can even happen with a fake
sense of closeness with, for example, celebrities, as illustrated in S1.
Benjamin linked the decline of aura to the mass reproduction of
art. AI literature, by its nature, is highly replicable and can be dis-
seminated widely, often without perceived cost. This accessibility
democratizes the production and consumption of literary works
but also strips them of the exclusivity and reverence traditionally
associated with the aura [ 89]. The ability of AI to produce infinite
variations of texts saturates the literary space (T4), further dilut-
ing the perceived uniqueness and artistic value of any single piece
of writing, including existing literature. This can already be seen
in the current discussions of ‘AI slop’4, the proliferation of poor-
quality GenAI media. The novelty of AI-generated literature may
create a kind of aura around the machine as the "author. " Audiences
might attribute a mystical quality to the AI’s ability to create works
that appear thoughtful, poetic, or profound, particularly when they
surpass expectations for machine creativity (S5, S6). The aura of
traditional literary works often stems from their historical and
cultural specificity and how they reflect the unique conditions of
their creation. AI-generated texts lack this connection because they
are based on training data from many times and places, creating

Infinity Book: Speculating Literary Expressions in the Age of Generative AI DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
a pastiche rather than a historically situated work. Even when AI
mimics a historical or cultural style (e.g., writing in the voice of
a 19th-century author), this imitation is not rooted in the authen-
tic and embodied experience (T8, S2, S11) of that context, further
complicating the relationship between AI works and aura.
7.2 Creative Agency
A recurring theme throughout the workshops was the question of
what remains uniquely human in creative work (T1, T2, T5, T9, T10,
S3, S5, S6, S9, S10, S12). This concern is part of a long-standing de-
bate about the economic, existential, and social impacts of AI-driven
revaluations of creative labor. Such concerns have been a critical
aspect of historical and contemporary discussions on the influence
of technology on the production, circulation, and consumption
of art and media. For instance, post-structuralist theories such as
Michel Foucault’s concept of the "author-function" [ 37] and Roland
Barthes’ proclamation of "The Death of the Author" [ 7] resonate
strongly in the context of AI-generated texts. These theories sug-
gest that texts are less the product of individual human creativity
and more the result of complex cultural and linguistic forces. In the
context of generative AI, these ideas take on new significance, as
the role of the human author becomes increasingly ambiguous (T8).
AI systems, trained on vast corpora of texts, inevitably produce
works that challenge traditional notions of authorship, suggesting
that language and culture, rather than individual human intent, are
speaking through creative works. This shift raises profound ques-
tions about ownership, originality, and the value of human creative
input (T1). For instance, who is the author of text generated by
an AI? [ 109] What does it mean for the concept of originality and
copyright [ 34] when an AI can produce a work that is indistinguish-
able from a human-authored one [ 24,79,80]? These are the kinds
of questions that the ambiguous role of the human author in the
context of generative AI provokes [ 5,107]. Potts [ 93] gives a broad
historical and critical overview of how the concept of authorship
has evolved over time and how generative AI complicates these
matters even further. These developments will shift the cultural
and social value placed on works created by humans (T1, T8).
The LLM-generated texts result from interactions within a vast
and temporally deep cognitive assemblage [ 45]. (T2) The human
programmers and users who train, refine, and deploy these algo-
rithms are part of the cognitive assemblage. So are the humans
(authors, editors, critics), tools and materials (writing implements,
printing machines, physical books), and institutions (publishers, li-
braries, bookshops) that were involved in the creation, distribution,
and circulation of the texts used as the training material for the mod-
els. The texts produced by AI are not just a product of the machine
as prompted by a user; it is the outcome of a distributed process
involving an immense assemblage of human and non-human cog-
nitive operations, both conscious and nonconscious ones. [ 47,48].
Crawford and Joler’s Anatomy of an AI System [26] visualizes the
complexity involved even in quite simple, in comparison to Infinity
Book , AI system, in this case Amazon Echo. Galit Wellner simi-
larly argues that the symbiosis of humans and machines forms a
condition for posthuman (or digital) imagination [ 114,115]. The
traditional notion of imagination as uniquely human and subjective
is translated into a layered model, where imaginative functionsare shared and diffused between humans and technologies. Unlike
Hayles [ 49], Wellner argues that, as of the moment, only humans
are capable of the uppermost layer of producing meaning [ 115]. We
hope that speculations like ours can bring conceptual and pragmatic
clarity to these thorny issues.
The workshops also mentioned the emergence of new literary
forms that would be impossible without GenAI, creating hybrid
modes of expression that blend human and machine creativity in
unprecedented ways, redefining what we mean by creativity [ 116].
These developments follow historical shifts in literary and cultural
production driven by technological advancements. Just as the inven-
tion of writing systems enabled a transition from orality to literacy,
and the industrialization of the printing press revolutionized lit-
erature in the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of computational
technologies, from word processing software to internet writing,
has profoundly altered how we create and consume texts. N. Kather-
ine Hayles’ concept of "postprint" [ 50] provides a useful framework
for understanding these shifts, as it discusses how computational
technologies have transformed the material conditions of literary
production. Generative AI represents the latest evolution in this
trajectory, offering tools that both expand the boundaries of literary
expression and provoke questions about the role of human agency
in creative processes. GenAI does not replicate human creativity; it
reconfigures the possibilities of literary expression, creating a space
where human and machine co-authorship can coexist and inform
one another. This reconfiguration pushes writers and creators to
explore the limits of traditional literary forms, experimenting with
texts that push the boundaries of literary expression [96].
7.3 Liveness
The participants questioned the nature of what constitutes a live,
immediate, and authentic “live” experience and the notion of in-
teractivity (T5, T6, T7, S7, S9, S10) Philip Auslander [ 4] argues
that liveness is not an inherent quality, but one that is historically
and culturally contingent and becomes particularly relevant in the
context of AI-driven literary forms. Generative AI allows for the
real-time creation of texts, performances, and interactive narratives,
blurring the lines between live and mediatized literary forms. For
example, AI can generate poetry, comedy, stories, or dialogue in
response to audience input during live performances, creating an
experience that is both immediate and dynamically responsive. This
challenges traditional distinctions between live and pre-recorded
or scripted content, further indicating that liveness in expression
is not confined to the physical presence of a human author or per-
former. However, the participants stated that the proliferation of
AI systems in media might change the cultural economics relating
to the physical human presence of the performer (T5).
As Auslander notes [ 4], the proliferation of media technologies
has influenced the aesthetics and practices of live performance,
pushing artists to incorporate mediatized elements into their work.
Similarly, generative AI forces writers and performers to engage
with digital tools that can modify or enhance live literary experi-
ences in real-time, thus reconfiguring the audience’s expectations
of what it means for a text to be performed "live." There was an em-
phasis on the narrative forms that rely on interactivity (or at least
potential interactivity). The examples from workshops range from
1440
DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal Holopainen, Huang, Shin, Nissinen, Lucero
interactive real-time detective stories (S7) to collaborative autofic-
tion generators (S9) as potential forms of AI-powered interactive
narratives [ 60]. This also echoes the trend in publishing moving
away from one-to-many text distribution and circulation models
to more dynamic and personal formulations of text and media. As
Kourkolou [ 62] states: “This evolution has been far more than a
simple shift from print to digital: it has fundamentally changed
the nature of publishing from a static, one-to-many model focused
solely on the circulation and distribution of text to a dynamic in-
terplay of forms and mediums.” The shift illustrates the potential
dangers caused by the loss of shared cultural artefacts (T3). If the
texts become increasingly personal, almost solipsistic, this might
erode the feeling of shared cultural meanings and values.
8 Discussion
We introduced three strong concepts—Creative Agency, Authen-
ticity, and Liveness—which serve to articulate and frame selected
sociotechnical dynamics emerging from our study as transferable
design concerns. These concepts were developed through an it-
erative process of analysis, drawing on the empirical materials
generated across the speculative workshops and design fiction
storyboards, and informed by theoretical perspectives from post-
phenomenology, posthumanist HCI, and more-than-human design.
Rather than claiming comprehensive coverage of the design space
for AI-mediated interaction, these concepts offer partial yet gener-
ative insights grounded in the specific imaginaries and materials
produced throughout the study, as well as the authors’ interpre-
tive positioning within critical and speculative design. Framed as
mid-level theoretical constructs, they are intended to support de-
signers and researchers in articulating, reflecting on, and evaluating
emergent interaction patterns with generative AI, particularly in
creative and narrative domains.
•Creative Agency reframes creativity as a co-constructed, ne-
gotiable dynamic between humans and generative systems,
informing the design of co-creative tools and authoring in-
terfaces.
•Authenticity draws attention to perceptions of value, prove-
nance, and trust in AI-generated content, relevant for inter-
action transparency, explainability, and user control.
•Liveness introduces a temporal and experiential lens to AI-
mediated interactions, useful for designing responsive, real-
time, or performative literary and artistic systems and po-
tentially giving rise to novel forms of literary expressions.
By formalizing these concepts, we provide design knowledge that
bridges philosophical critique and practical application, especially
in the emerging area of human–AI co-creation [113].
8.1 Advancing Participatory Speculative Design
in Interaction Design
While speculative design has long been recognized as a valuable
approach within the field (e.g. [ 28]), our study builds on this foun-
dation by introducing a multi-method process that enhances and
extends participatory speculation. By combining speculative design
workshops, dialogue-labs, and design fiction, we offer a structured
framework for engaging stakeholders in critical and imaginativeexploration of future technologies. Our methodological contribu-
tion lies in giving a concrete example of how participatory spec-
ulation can be effectively scaffolded through the integration of
diverse techniques, including the Future Ripples method, 6-3-5
brainwriting, and dialogue-labs . Combination of these techniques
generated nuanced situated imaginaries of life with GenAI and
demonstrated how speculative artefacts (like Infinity Book) can
be used as prompts for reflection across diverse participant back-
grounds [ 32]. This supports ongoing efforts to integrate speculative
practices into early-stage design research while producing insights
for both critique and ideation.
8.2 Exemplifying Posthumanist and
More-than-Human Perspectives
Our study provides a concrete example of how posthumanist the-
ories can inform the design process and practice along critique
[36,38]. By treating AI as an active participant in creative assem-
blages, we move beyond anthropocentric framings of interaction
and shift toward relational, networked, and hybrid views of author-
ship, agency, and creativity. This has implications for designing sys-
tems where boundaries between user, tool, and content are increas-
ingly fluid. It aligns well with recent work calling for posthumanist
and more-than-human design perspectives [ 86] and contributes a
speculative domain where such ideas can be meaningfully exam-
ined. Moreover, by imagining resistance to or reformulation of AI
systems, we illustrate how designing for plural futures can surface
cultural tensions and ethical fault lines. This strengthens the role
of designing for contested future worlds in anticipating the broader
societal impacts of AI [25].
8.3 Speculative Scenarios as Situated Design
Probes
The twelve speculative scenarios (Appendix A) offer concrete in-
sights into emerging interaction possibilities with GenAI. The sce-
narios serve a dual role: they are provocative in surfacing design
tensions (e.g., manipulation vs. agency, automation vs. skill) and
generative in inspiring concrete design moves (e.g., real-time feed-
back, authorship interface metaphors). As exploratory and future-
oriented design artifacts, they extend the interaction design space
and support ideation, reflection, and dialogue [ 8] on GenAI’s po-
tential to transform literary expressions. Each scenario serves as a
situated design probe that explores how AI systems might trans-
form literary practices, user roles, and system behaviors. They
translate abstract futures into tangible design situations, such as
conversational onboarding, affect-aware storytelling, author-avatar
negotiations, and AI-driven real-time fiction, providing detailed
material for examining how interaction design and cultural context
shape user experience [ 10]. The scenarios also act as invitations
for deeper reflection on the societal, cultural, and existential impli-
cations of generative AI. They explore how identities, institutions,
and worldviews may be reshaped by those interactions. The scenar-
ios offer scaffolds for engaging with existential design challenges
[68] such as the commodification of creativity and loss of creative
autonomy, the emergence of new forms of algorithmic governance
over cultural production, and the potential atrophy of human inter-
pretive agency in an era of infinite machine-authored texts.

Infinity Book: Speculating Literary Expressions in the Age of Generative AI DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
8.4 Limitations and Future Work
Even though we had participants from various backgrounds, in-
cluding professional authors and digital literature experts, we did
not include people from, for example, the publishing industry or
journalism. This might be why the results from the workshops
mainly focus on aspects of preparation, creation, curation, and
consumption of fictional works. Important parts of publishing, cir-
culation, reception (critique), and legacy [ 84] are hardly touched
upon. Similarly, reflections on important issues such as ethical
concerns, privacy, security, ownership, and ecological impacts are
lacking. In the next rounds of workshops, we aim to include peo-
ple from other parts of the book creation cycle and focus more on
the above-mentioned issues. The participants, although many with
international backgrounds, were almost all based in Hong Kong.
Further workshops in different cultures would reveal new aspects.
We have planned to replicate some of the workshops in Helsinki,
Shanghai, and Seoul. This far, only the authors have used the design
fiction storyboards for further speculations, limiting the scope and
depth of the insights. We plan to polish and edit the storyboards and
have them available online, also as a way to gather feedback and
further ideas from a wider public. We plan to develop some of the
more concrete ideas presented here or emerging from the further
workshops into prototypes by ourselves or other research teams.
Currently, the most concrete ideas for further development focus
on exploring new forms of literature only possible using GenAI,
although we are also exploring how to develop more refined de-
sign fictions, including interactive (or semi-interactive) prototypes,
which focus on the wider social and existential issues. Although
they were not used in these studies, we have started, among many
others [ 11,65], experimenting with generative AI tools as part of
the speculative design process. Especially using LLMs as partners
in the ideation process and as tools for analyzing the workshop
results looks like a promising area for further study.
9 Conclusions
This study focused on critical speculation on the potential impact of
GenAI systems on literary expression and their broader influence
on the socio-material world. To further this inquiry, we proposed
the concept of the Infinity Book , a hypothetical future system capa-
ble of generating a wide range of literary works, including novels,
short stories, and poems. This proposal is driven by recognizing
the cultural significance of books, which have long served as a vital
medium for encapsulating, transmitting, and preserving knowledge.
By examining these intersections, we speculated how AI-generated
literature might reshape how stories are created, consumed, and
valued in contemporary society. We reported the results of three
speculative design workshops and two dialogue-labs around the
critical envisioning of Infinity Book to answer the following re-
search questions: How do systems automating literary creation like
Infinity Book shape the sociomaterial world and human-technology
relationships? What overall interaction design concerns arise for such
systems?
All in all, the workshops had 37 participants from various back-
grounds, including interaction designers, media artists, and pro-
fessional authors. Reflexive Thematic Analysis of the workshop
outputs resulted in ten broader themes addressing issues around thefuture of literary expression in the age of generative AI ( Revaluation
of Labour, Redefining Creativity and Imagination, Fragmentations
and Divisions, Content Pollution and Control, Back to Human!, AI as
an Expression Formulator, Personalized Fiction, Embodied Meaning,
Background Relations , and Agency and Authenticity ). Based on the
results, we created twelve design fictions exploring these issues
further. Finally, we reflected on the findings and traced the potential
impacts of systems such as Infinity Book and further explored the
implications of generative AI on our understanding of the rapidly
changing posthuman world. We formulated these reflections as
three strong concepts: Authenticity, Creative Agency , and Liveness .
We hope the results, especially the design fictions, will stimulate
further experimentation in this area.

APPENDICES
A Scenarios
Onboarding the User (S1): The user wants to listen to audiobooks while jogging, but they feel that the available books are not
engaging enough. The user downloads the Infinity Book App to their mobile phone as everyone has talked about the service and
it is free to download. The onboarding uses a personal AI-powered assistant, Mark, with a speech interface. Mark starts to chat
with the user in order to create a detailed user profile, instructing the user to allow recording of as many of their daily activities
as possible. After recording the user’s life for a day, Mark notifies the user that their profile is ready. Mark recommends a
personalized book for the user, who now listens to an engaging spy thriller created just for them.

Infinity Book Operations (S2): A recent Infinity Book Corporation employee is introduced to the operations at IB headquarters.
He is taken through the massive server rooms hosting the models capable of generating countless fictional worlds in a second
to the central operations room. The mentor explains to the new employee how the IB system bypasses the need for the authors
to experience real life in all its bodily nuances. Now the IB system has rights for the generative models of vast amounts of
authors, both dead and alive, which can instantly create literary works in their authentic style.

Fine-tuning the Author Model (S3): A famous living author has given their rights to IB Corporation. Training on the author’s
existing works is not nuanced enough for the outputs to sound authentic, so the real author has to go through a strenuous
training program. The author sits in a room facing an AI-powered model of themselves. The model interrogates the author
about their life, invoking painful moments through various props. In addition to the video recordings, the system also monitors
the author’s brain activity and psychophysiological reactions. Paul Auster was still alive when this storyboard was created.
We decided to keep this and the following author scenarios as they highlight the issues of retaining and using author-tuned
models even after the author’s death.
Harold The Recommender Bot (S4): The user has a discussion with Harold, the recommender bot, through a video call interface.
Harold looks like an old-school academic in his office. The office walls are covered with bookshelves. The user says to Harold
that he has just finished a trilogy by a famous author and would like to read more of that style. Harold recommends the fourth
installment in the series, which, of course, confuses the user as the author has not written such a novel. Harold replies that it
will not be a problem as the user can talk to the author bot directly to get advice.
1448
DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal Holopainen, Huang, Shin, Nissinen, Lucero
Conversation with the Author (S5): The user discusses the possibility of the fourth novel in the trilogy with the life-like
representation of the author. During the discussion, the author explains some principles ablankg moments of their creative
process, recommends some additional reading to the user, and finally agrees to write the fourth novel, which is instantly
available to the user.
Feedback to the Author (S6): The user really liked the fourth novel in the trilogy and wants to discuss it with the author. The
user gives his views on the main themes and features of the novel while the author explains the themes in more depth and also
gives justifications for the crucial creative choices they made. In the end, the author recommends reading generated novels
from other authors in the IB roster, again including both living and dead ones.

Infinity Book: Speculating Literary Expressions in the Age of Generative AI DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal
Real-time Detective Novel (S7): The user is commuting in a subway train listening to an audiobook generated by IB. The book is
a dynamically evolving narrative that transforms the user’s everyday life and surroundings into an endless, personalized fiction.
As the user listens, IB uses the cameras and microphones in their Augmented Reality glasses to monitor the environment,
seamlessly blending the real world with the story. Drawing from social media profiles, IB identifies people around the user,
weaving them into the narrative as fictionalized characters. The user, who becomes the protagonist of this tale, sees these
individuals highlighted in their augmented reality view, knowing that IB is crafting backstories for them that blend fact with
fiction. The story centers around the user’s quest for a mysterious book, a journey that takes them through the urban landscape
they inhabit. Their actions are narrated in the third person, giving the reader an external perspective on their own life as
they follow clues and chase down leads. The search leads them to a small bookstore where more clues are uncovered. As they
explore, IB recognizes another listener in the bookstore, revealing that their stories are intertwined. The AI weaves together
information from the internet, the history of the bookstore, and fictional elements to create the narrative.

DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal Holopainen, Huang, Shin, Nissinen, Lucero
Business Practices (S8): Dissatisfaction with IB operations is growing as traditional media struggles to survive. The narrator
takes the reader on a tour of a gentrified urban district, revealing IB’s quiet takeover of cultural spaces. Traditional book
publishing is a loss-making venture, more of a promotional tool than a profitable business. Authors now rely on platforms like
paid Twitch channels to engage with their dedicated fans, who pay to be part of the creative process. Bookstores and libraries
are being replaced by IB-controlled showrooms filled with hollow books offering digital excerpts. IB aims to monopolize the
market, erasing the era of physical books and traditional reading spaces in favor of a future where digital content and corporate
control prevail.

Interactive Personalised Horror Stories (S9): A staunch climate change denialist listens to AI fiction at home. In the fiction,
eco-terrorists attack the man and his family’s home. The terrorists are frightening swamp-dwelling humanoid creatures who
force the family to calculate their total carbon footprint, including their car usage, eating habits, international flights, home
heating, etc. The terrorists give a lecture on the current state of the environment and how much damage people living like this
family cause. The family is taken to a swamp eco-concentration camp where they are forced into slave labor. The fiction takes
place at home but uses real-world environmental cues extracted from smart home sensors and cameras in the narrative. AI
knows the users’ fears and desires better than they do themselves as it has access to the user’s life profile. Using this information,
AI can create material that can have an emotional impact also on the subconscious level.

DIS ’25, July 05–09, 2025, Funchal, Portugal Holopainen, Huang, Shin, Nissinen, Lucero
Autofiction Generator (S10): The user wakes up. Eats breakfast. Goes to work, here various things happen. Stops at the grocery
store on the way home. Heats up macaroni casserole for dinner. Watches the news. Takes a shower. Goes to bed. In the evening,
in bed, the user reads a dramatized, autofictional version of their day written by AI. The story repeats the user’s day but in a
dramatized version. Ordinary events take on new meaning. Dramatic arcs from different days interconnect. The mundane
aspects of the user’s day become new and exciting through the story. In the AI’s autofiction, shorter stories cover a single day
and larger narrative arcs encompass the whole life.
Your Body as Training Data (S11): A person volunteers to have a sensor implanted in their brain in exchange for financial
compensation. After signing a contract, a neurosurgeon installs the device, which allows an AI to monitor the person’s thoughts,
sensations, and actions. As they go about their daily life, the AI occasionally interrupts with strange commands, pushing them
to perform bizarre acts, like pouring syrup on their hand or spilling hot coffee on their thighs while sitting in a café. The
AI’s experiments are not random; it seeks to gather data on human sensations—how pain, discomfort, and confusion feel in
real-time. But the AI’s curiosity goes beyond physical responses; it is deeply interested in the social and psychological effects
of these unusual behaviors. It observes how the person reacts to breaking social norms and how their emotions shift as they
navigate these public disruptions. The story explores the boundaries between human autonomy and artificial manipulation,
questioning what happens when technology probes into the most intimate corners of human experience.

A Character Looking for a World (S12): The user interacts with an AI character, visible through VR glasses. The AI character
initially appears neutral and blank in personality and traits. The user wants the AI character to express opposing views on life,
marriage, politics, culture, etc., compared to the user’s own opinions. The user wants the AI character to be passionate about
and eager to defend its beliefs. Gradually, the AI character evolves into a figure who passionately supports Maoist ideology.
During the conversation, the AI character’s face, body, gestures, and clothing take on more individualistic and distinctive
features. The user places the character into an AI-created story universe once the character is fully developed). The user feels a
sense of satisfaction from contributing to creating this narrative world, making the experience of following the story even
more engaging. The user is particularly drawn to following the character’s journey they helped create.
