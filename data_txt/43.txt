Abstract 
Animals living alongside humans are navigating a world increas-
ingly flled with technology, yet little is known about how they 
interface with these systems, whether designed for, with, or around 
them. Anchored in HCI and ranging across diverse felds, this scop-
ing review analyzes nearly 800 research works to explore the diverse 
realities of animal-technology research, examining the who, what, 
why, and how of animal-technology entanglements. Our analysis 
revealed 11 research objectives and eight types of technologies 
across six animal contexts. By categorizing the literature based on 
authors’ aims and intended benefciaries, we highlight trends, gaps, 
and ethical considerations. We fnd that most systems involve ani-
mals with limited potential for direct engagement or sense-making. 
We propose a framework to understand animals as users versus 
subjects of interactive systems, focusing on feedback, empirical 
testing, and projected animal benefts. Our fndings ofer a founda-
tion to understand current and future animal technology research 
and the diversity of animal user experience.

The use of tools in animals across species have been documented as 
dating back millennia, from chimpanzees building hammers [13] or 
using sticks to extract termites [142], to dolphins wearing marine 
sponges to protect their snouts while foraging on the seafoor [150]. 
Animals have also been interacting with human-made technologies 
in various forms for over a century, bringing new dimensions to 
how they engage with the world. Some early examples – often 
problematic – of animal-technology interaction include pigeons 
trained in the 1940s to operate touch screens to guide missiles [147], 
or gorillas such as Koko, trained in 1977 to select icons on a Mac 
II as part of animal cognition research [121]. As technology ad-
vances and our coexistence and relationships with animals evolve, 
the prevalence of animal-technology interactions appears to be 
expanding. However, this trend has yet to be fully quantifed. 
Additionally, conceptual approaches towards developing tech-
nologies for animals, along with the consideration of whom these 
technologies are ultimately designed to beneft, have also evolved 
in the past decades, notably since the 2011 Manifesto on Animals-
Computer Interaction [96]. This paradigm shift towards an animal-
centric design philosophy draws from principles established in the 
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community towards more eth-
ical and empathetic design practices. Rather than using animals 
merely as tools to serve human purposes, there is now a greater 
emphasis on creating technologies to enhance the welfare and au-
tonomy of the animals themselves. Researchers within the Animal-
Computer Interaction (ACI) and HCI communities are recognizing 
the need to consider an animal’s perspective, which encompasses 
not only their behavioral responses but also their sensory experi-
ences, preferences, and well-being. 
The intersection of animals and technology spans a diverse array 
of felds, contexts, objectives, and types of technology–where tech-
nology can be broadly defned as digital or computational systems 
involving some form of input and/or output. This broad defnition 
encompasses a wide range of applications, from wearables for as-
sistive dogs [71], to bioacoustic wildlife monitoring systems for 
conservation [166]. It includes vision-based health monitoring sys-
tems in cows aimed at physical health and productivity [165], as 
well as social enrichment video-calling systems for pets [80]. Given 
this diversity and evolving perspective, there is value in capturing 

CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kleinberger et al. 
and disentangling the broad landscape of animal-technology re-
search to chart the varying forms of animal engagement, the diverse 
approaches to animal understanding and usership, the intended 
benefciaries of these systems, and the potential relevance for the 
broader feld of HCI. 
In this context, we present a scoping review of technological 
systems designed for, or used with animals. Following PRISMA-ScR 
guidelines [ 160] and Arksey & O’Malley’s framework [ 4], we ana-
lyzed 795 research works spanning over 200 venues. Our methodol-
ogy, beginning with the ACM digital library and extending beyond it 
through ancestry searching and snowballing, enables us to map the 
landscape of animal-technology research through multiple lenses: 
who (authors, species, contexts), what (technologies), why (benef-
ciaries, objectives), and how (empirical testing, ethical standards). 
The contributions of this work are fourfold: 
• A typology of animal-technology research, classifying con-
texts, technologies, objectives, benefciaries, and ethical con-
siderations. 
• A comprehensive mapping of the animal-technology re-
search landscape between 2000 and 2024, revealing rising 
trends in conceptual works, context-specifc silos in technol-
ogy application, limited feedback for the animals, and varied 
approaches to ethical considerations. 
• A framework for understanding animals’ roles as users vs 
subjects in interactive systems based on the potential of 
sense-making through sensory feedback, intended benef-
ciaries, and empirical testing, complemented by systematic 
analyses of (1) the distribution of tactile, visual, auditory, and 
olfactory feedback modalities and (2) the framing of benef-
ciary roles across diferent animal contexts and technologies. 
• An analysis of ACI’s relevance to HCI, identifying eight 
key intersections, namely: human-in-the-loop design; multi-
species interdependence; methodological innovation, physi-
ological diversity, post-human perspectives, environmental 
sustainability, evolutionary understanding, and designing 
for otherness. 
Based on these fndings, we propose concrete recommendations 
and practical steps for experienced ACI practitioners and HCI re-
searchers interested in extending their work to animals. 
This work aims to inform both theoretical discourse and practi-
cal application in HCI and ACI communities and for stakeholders 
across domains. For example, our mapping of ethical considerations 
and institutional oversight can provide policy makers with data-
backed evidence on current gaps in intervention standards. Our 
analysis of the presence and distribution of feedback modalities 
(tactile, visual, auditory, olfactive, etc.) for animals to potentially 
make sense of the interactions, can ofer caregivers a road map to 
explore technologies appropriateness for their own contexts. Our 
framework for classifying animals as users versus subjects pro-
vides developers and researchers with practical criteria to evaluate 
their approaches. Although the scope of this review is extensive, 
its breadth enables us to provide a more holistic evidence-based 
understanding of how animals and technology interact, supporting 
more thoughtful development of animal-centered technology in 
research and practice. 2 Background 
As the feld of HCI expands into the animal realm, researchers 
are increasingly exploring how animals engage with technology, 
whether as unknowing participants, active users, or coerced sub-
jects [89]. There is value in extending the user-centered principles 
of HCI to animals, as a way to promote new methods that prioritize 
animal welfare, engagement, and agency [96]. This section provides 
an overview of recent works in animal technology, key concepts of 
interaction within HCI, and the complex roles of animals as users 
or subjects of technology. 
2.1 Evolution of ACI 
As a young discipline, ACI draws from HCI, adapting its frame-
works to consider animals’ use of technology. While some areas 
of ACI focus on non-invasive and seamless inclusion of data with-
out animal awareness, such as health monitoring systems or facial 
recognition, others have explored agency-enhancing technologies 
that ofer animals more control and choice over their lives and envi-
ronment [80, 82, 104]. The feld has produced a large body of work 
promoting best practices for improved engagement and ethics [98]. 
For instance, unlike traditional animal research methods that often 
rely on food rewards and constrained settings, ACI may rather 
promote innovative user engagement methods and non-coercive 
feedback systems that leverage and respect animals’ natural behav-
iors [20]. There has also been eforts to expand such ACI approach 
to ethics and animal involvement to wider, or more traditional, 
animal behaviour felds [99]. 
However, despite growing conceptual work supporting ethical 
and agency-focused animal-centered principles [98], the application 
of these principles remains uneven and illusive [6]. Some technolo-
gies designed for animals still lack the depth of refection around 
usership and engagement seen in human-centered designs. Eforts 
have been made to explore how animals can inform the design 
process through their individual characteristics, behaviors, and 
needs [1]. Yet, only a few have attempted to quantify and charac-
terize the scope of what interaction means in the feld. 
2.2 Literature Reviews of Animal-Technology 
In the past few years, a handful of review works have emerged, each 
providing a distinct lens on animal-technology research. Hirskyj-
Douglas’ review [59] categorizes studies by type of technology be-
tween tangible and physical, haptic and wearable, olfactory, screen-
based and tracking interfaces and context. Jukan et al.[75] reviewed 
80 studies focused on smart technologies and animal welfare, explor-
ing how these technologies contribute to keeping animals healthy 
and positively stimulated, particularly in farming settings. Likewise, 
Egelkamp and colleagues [32] examined a corpus of 72 instances of 
zoo animals’ interactions with screen-based systems, highlighting 
opportunities for cognitive and enrichment applications. Mean-
while, Gupfnger et al.[50] explored the historical and current uses 
of technology for auditory expression among animals, particularly 
in the context of music. Ashooh et al. [5] established a corpus of 
79 ACI articles to survey demographic reporting standards across 
felds. Kresnye et al.[87] reviewed a corpus of 102 studies, catego-
rizing research by animal context (e.g., lab, farm, zoo, companion, 
wildlife) and methods used, focusing on enrichment-based systems 
Animals’ Entanglement with Technology: a Scoping Review CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
framed for animal welfare, thus not incorporating the many other 
reasons technology is used with animals in the feld. Although 
the work was not directly focused on animals, Webber and col-
leagues [168] conducted a scoping review of 103 research works 
on nature engagement highlighting the relevance of this model of 
structured approach to the CHI community. Although each of these 
reviews ofers valuable insight, they often focus on specifc con-
texts or technologies, typically examining around 100 studies, many 
of which are now over seven years old. This leaves a signifcant 
gap in our comprehensive understanding of animal-technology 
interactions across settings. 
2.3 Conceptualizing Interaction in HCI and ACI 
The concept of ’interaction’ has been extensively debated in HCI, 
often in attempts to characterize and understand how users engage 
with systems, resulting in acknowledging the complexity and vari-
ability of the term. Hornbæk [63] quantifed the increasing number 
of modifers used with the word “interaction” in HCI, suggesting a 
growing complexity and standardization in how the term is applied. 
Various defnitions have been proposed. For example, some have 
conceptualized interaction as a dialogue, a cyclical process of taking 
turns transmitting and receiving acts [116]. Others have defned 
interaction in terms of tool usage, in which a user manipulates 
something to have some efect or outcome in the world [64]. Others 
still have defned interaction in terms of a user’s experience and 
how they experience a product or service [53]. A widely favored 
model views interaction as a relationship based on a feedback loop 
between a user and a system, highlighting the importance of system 
responses in shaping the user experience [47]. In this model, feed-
back becomes a crucial component of interaction, allowing users to 
engage meaningfully with technology. In ACI, this feedback loop is 
often left incomplete, as the animal’s understanding of the interac-
tion is rarely fully known and frequently not prioritized in system 
design [59]. 
These challenges in designing for and evaluating non-human 
interaction push us to question our basic assumptions about what 
constitutes interaction. The study of animals using technology 
can thus bring new perspectives on the concept of interaction 
for HCI. However, like early HCI, the terminology used in the 
animal feld about interaction has not yet been clearly concep-
tualized or defned. ACI researchers have considered interaction 
broadly, including: systems in which animals exert control over a 
system [16, 133, 177], technologies that respond to animal behav-
ior [44], tools for quantifying animal’s interaction with humans 
through behavior analysis [90, 106, 113, 130, 161], or human tech-
nologies for simulating animal sensory experiences and co-presence 
to build empathy across species [81, 162, 175]. One of ACI’s objec-
tives is to explore how technology can be made more usable for 
animals and create meaningful experiences for them, studying spe-
cifc parts of the feedback loop, such as how animals can input 
to technology [73, 124, 137, 177], how animals can be soothed or 
stimulated by technology [8, 44], and how animals and humans 
can connect through technology [21, 91, 106, 113]. However, the 
application of these HCI concepts to animals presents challenges, 
particularly when trying to infer understanding or intentionality, 
which are difcult to assess in non-human users [59]. 2.4 Animals as Users vs. Subjects of Technology 
An important conceptual distinction is in determining when ani-
mals are users of technology versus subjects. Usership implies a 
level of engagement, agency, and potential understanding of tech-
nology, moving beyond the traditional view of animals as passive 
recipients of human-imposed systems. Lawson et al. [89] explore 
this distinction in terms of consent and the extent to which tech-
nologies are imposed on animals. This raises further questions 
about the criteria needed for animals to be considered users and 
the role played by feedback and understanding. 
Several studies have explored these boundaries, examining how 
technologies can provide animals with feedback to facilitate sense-
making [ 40, 59]. The so-called “gulf of evaluation” in HCI—where 
users interpret the outcomes of their actions—has been applied to 
animals, highlighting the challenges of closing this feedback loop 
in non-verbal species [115]. As the animal’s understanding of what 
the interaction means is not fully known, this area remains an open 
feld of inquiry, with ongoing debates about what constitutes true 
interaction and understanding in animals. Although these open 
questions allow for rich discussions and diverse perspectives, they 
also present challenges for consistent data-supported approaches 
and assessments. Our work aims to address these gaps by syn-
thesizing fndings across diverse contexts of animal-technology 
interactions in order to contribute to HCI discussions on user-
centered design, feedback, and agency, fostering more inclusive 
and empathetic technological practices. 
2.5 ACI Positioning and Relevance for HCI 
The relationship between HCI and ACI has been a subject of schol-
arly discussion, with researchers exploring how these felds inform 
and enrich each other. Key works examining this relationship in-
clude a 2016 ACM NordiCHI workshop "Where HCI meets ACI" [60] 
and Mancini’s seminal paper [97], which argued that ACI is di-
rectly relevant to and even encompasses HCI. This work proposed 
three key benefts of ACI to HCI: strengthening HCI as a discipline 
through comparative study of interaction, broadening participa-
tion in interaction design through multispecies considerations, and 
supporting sustainability through more inclusive design practices. 
To understand this ACI/HCI relationship, it may also be help-
ful to consider how HCI itself has evolved and whether one can 
observe parallels or diferences in the evolution of ACI. Bødker’s 
highly recognized work identifes three waves of HCI research and 
practice [11, 12]. The frst wave, emerging in the 1970s, empha-
sized human factors engineering and cognitive science, focusing on 
optimizing human-machine interaction through controlled experi-
ments. The second wave (1990s) introduced workplace studies and 
computer-supported cooperative work, recognizing the importance 
of context and practice. The third wave broadened to consider emo-
tional, social, and cultural aspects of technology use in everyday life. 
More recently, scholars have proposed an emerging fourth wave 
characterized by post-humanist perspectives [138] and consider-
ations of human-technology entanglement [39], where questions 
of ethics and agency become central. These waves parallel what 
Harrison [52] described as the three paradigms of HCI: Human 
Factors, Classical Cognitivism, and Phenomenologically-Situated, 
ofering perspectives on the feld’s evolution. 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kleinberger et al. 
At frst glance, the evolution of ACI can appear to mirror aspects 
of HCI’s development, particularly in the positioning of its sub-
jects: from objects of modeling and study (as seen in Skinner boxes 
and animal models [148]) to actors supported within their existing 
communities of practice through technological support in contexts 
as diverse as working animals [71, 135] or animal agriculture [51]. 
However, there has been little structured research that has exam-
ined either the linearity of this evolution or its implications for 
HCI research. In this context, where ACI as a feld demonstrates 
potential value for HCI development, we believe that a large-scale 
review can provide insights into how these domains intersect. Our 
analysis examines this relationship through two lenses: the tempo-
ral evolution of both felds relative to HCI’s waves of development, 
and the specifc ways ACI can inform and enhance HCI practices 
across multiple dimensions and vice versa. 
3 Methodology 
This scoping review aimed to address the who, what, why, and how 
of animal technology research from an HCI perspective focusing on 
interaction. We sought to paint a general picture of this feld, iden-
tify gaps and opportunities, and provide insights for researchers 
focusing on animals as users of interactive technology. This review 
followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guide-
lines [160]. Our approach was guided by the fve stages of Arksey 
& O’Malley’s framework for scoping reviews [4]: (1) identifying 
the research question, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) study 
selection, (4) charting the data, and (5) collating, summarizing, and 
reporting results. The team was composed of two feld experts each 
with over ten years of expertise in ACI (frst and last author) who 
were in charge of creating the corpus, iteratively refning the cat-
egories by refecting on the mapped landscape and analyzing the 
data. Two trained labelers (second and third author) received train-
ing in category classifcation, reviewed and encoded the papers, 
consulted with the frst author for any questions, and participated 
in the team discussions.

clusion, from ACM library search round evaluations, and the

3.1 Identifying research questions 
This work starts with the goal of drawing a broad picture of various 
felds, objectives, techniques, and contexts where animals meet 
technology to understand the diversity of how interaction is un-
derstood. As this context encompasses a very varied type of work, 
where animals are involved in a wide range of technology for very diverse objectives, we begin by casting a broad net on the feld 
and establish defnition and boundaries. To identify the current 
landscape, trends, and gaps, we start with the questions of Who, 
What, Why, and How. 
• WHO: Identifes researchers, targeted animals, species, and 
their roles. It includes the publication venues and author 
afliations, as well as the animal species and context. 
• WHAT: Examines the type of technology used, categorized 
based on the technological elements described by the au-
thors. 
• WHY: Explores the stated objectives and benefciaries, cate-
gorizing them into relevant groups. 
• HOW: Investigates both design and methodological aspects 
including empirical testing, presence and type of feedback, 
mention of ethical consideration or institutional approval. 
This framework provided a structure to analyze how scholarly 
work in animal technology has considered the various ways animals 
and technology interact. 
3.2 Selecting Relevant Articles 
In collaboration with a research librarian, we developed a search 
strategy to identify relevant literature starting with an initial corpus 
set, screened independently by two reviewers, then extended with 
forward and backward citation search, delimited with inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. The search was conducted from June to 
August 2024 and included papers published between 01/01/2000, 
and 06/01/2024. 
3.2.1 Corpus starting set, citations search. We conducted an initial 
search of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital 
library for the core starting set as a manageable source and to an-
chor the corpus into interaction-focused systems. A test search of 
the term "animal" yielded over 400,000 results for full-text search 
and over 60,000 results for abstract search. Consequently, for man-
ageability, we limited our search of animal-related keywords to 
the title using singular and plural versions of over a dozen animal 
species as well as general animal-related terms. As it is common 
practice in ACM research to use literary devices in their titles, we 
explored possible euphemistic, metaphorical, and idiomatic terms 
that could be used to refer to animals. To add focus on the interac-
tion between the animal and the technology, we constrained our 
search to publications containing interaction-related terms within 
the abstract, The full query syntax can be found Figure 2. 
The search yielded a total of 323 results. We used Covidence, a 
web-based software platform, to manage the screening process us-
ing titles and abstracts [28]. The frst and last authors independently 
screened all titles and abstracts (and when needed, full-text review) 
against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were re-
solved through discussion, with a third reviewer consulted when 
necessary. This resulted in 162 items for our corpus starting set. 
Next, we used SpiderCite [ 152] to conduct forward and backward 
citation search to identify additional relevant articles, extending 
our search beyond ACM. This systematic approach examines both 
all the works citing our initial papers (forward citation) and works 
cited by them (backward citation) essentially allowing to navigate 
both "upstream" and "downstream" in the research lineage related 
to a particular study. While broader database queries (e.g., through

us to specifcally examine how the CHI community engages with 
animal-technology research while maintaining a manageable cor-
pus size. Such citation-based method, which has been shown to 
yield comparable results to database searches [72], more specifcally 
aims to reveal the evolution of ideas within and beyond a specifc 
community. This search led to an additional 3,071 papers being 
screened similarly to the starting set. This resulted in an additional 
633 items being added to the corpus. Over the two screening phases, 
the two reviewers obtained an inter-rater reliability score of 87% 
calculated by Covidence as percentage agreement. 
3.2.2 Terminology and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our screening 
and selection process was based on terminology and agreed-upon 
defnitions of key terms (animals, technology, and interaction) as 
well as clear inclusion and exclusion criteria iterated upon by the 
two reviewers based on preliminary feld exploration and con-
cretized from the starting-set screening process. We considered 
the studies that met the following criteria: 
• Inclusion 1: Studies focusing on the interaction between 
animals and technology 
• Inclusion 2: Publication date between 2000 and 2024 
• Inclusion 3: English language only publications 
• Inclusion 4: Peer-reviewed journal articles, conference pa-
pers, and book chapters 
• Exclusion 1: Publications focused solely on robotic animals 
or virtual representations of animals 
• Exclusion 2: Workshop proposals, doctoral symposium pa-
pers, or news articles 
• Exclusion 3: Papers that considered animals as an abstraction 
or metaphor for storytelling 
• Exclusion 4: Biological or biomedical research using animals 
solely as models for human health research 
We chose to exclude work related to the use of technology in 
biomedical research that primarily benefts human health. However, 
we included enrichment technology for laboratory animals. We 
excluded applications for farm management but included farming 
technology that is directly in contact with animals. We excluded research on robot animals or virtual animals but included work 
using animal data to inform robot design or studies on animals’ 
reactions to robots. The starting set review also helped crystallize 
our working defnitions of key terms used for this review, including 
animals, technology, and interaction: 
Animals: We defned animals as non-human, multicellular eu-
karyotic organisms. This included all life stages, including pre-
hatching eggs, but excluded microbes and plants. We included 
studies on dead animals only if used as a proxy for live animal in-
teraction with technology, like in the case of research on European 
hedgehogs and automatic lawnmowers, where the research aimed 
to inform technology design for live animals [129]. 
Technology: We focused on digital or computational systems. 
We began the work without preconceptions about technology, al-
lowing for a broad exploration of the feld. We included both pro-
totypes and fully developed technologies, as well as speculative 
designs that were conceptualized but not yet implemented. How-
ever, we excluded purely methodological or animal training work 
that did not cover digital or computational elements. 
Interaction: We defned interaction broadly as a process where 
an input leads to a change in output within a system [ 64]. In our 
context we considered interaction to occur when either an animal-
based input has consequences within a technological system, or 
when a technological system’s output is made to be used in the 
context of animals. We considered interaction regardless of bidirec-
tionality, consciousness, agency, or the animal’s understanding of 
the systems to explore the full range of animal-technology engage-
ments in research. 
3.3 Charting the Data 
Following Arksey et al.’s [4] "descriptive-analytical" method, we 
processed each paper to extract relevant data. 
3.3.1 General Extraction Process. We used a multi-step approach in-
volving diferent levels of detail based on the paper type. A primary 
extraction template was applied to the full corpus, capturing general 
metadata, including author afliations and venues and distinguish-
ing between conceptual works and interactive systems, directing 
subsequent steps. For interactive systems, further detailed extrac-
tion was performed to answer the key questions of WHO, WHAT, 
WHY, and HOW. These questions guided our understanding of the 
species involved, technological context, feedback mechanisms, and 
the intended benefciaries. Finally, interactive systems that included 
empirical testing underwent an additional layer of data extraction. 
Here, we specifcally examined for potential feedback provided to 
animals, and the ethical considerations reported. The extraction 
template was developed by the frst author and iteratively refned 
through multiple rounds of analysis on the initial starting set, each 
followed by a reprocessing of the full set. 
3.3.2 Use of AI Tools and Manual Verification. Each paper was 
assigned to one of the four authors and a preliminary stage of data 
extraction was done using Claude.ai [3], a large language model, to 
standardize and streamline the process. Using an identical query 
prompt, the AI tool provided an initial pass of data extraction, 
which was then meticulously reviewed by the assigned author to 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kleinberger et al. 
Figure 3: Search Methodology in three steps: frst, the extrac-
tion of metadata and paper types from our entire corpus; 
second, a more detailed extraction for items categorized as 
"interactive systems," and third, declared ethics statements 
for empirically tested systems 
correct any inaccuracies and address potential biases inherent in 
AI processing. 
Indeed, recognizing the potential limitations and biases of AI-
assisted analysis, we implemented a rigorous manual verifcation 
process. Every piece of data extracted by Claude.ai was reviewed 
and, if necessary, corrected by the assigned author. Although fre-
quent minor corrections were needed, with about 80% of papers 
requiring some manual adjustment, this process still helped in op-
timizing our process and productivity due to the large volume of 
papers. Approximately 90% of the papers were straightforward to 
chart following this initial extraction. For the remaining 10%, which 
involved more complex theoretical issues or conficting interpre-
tations, discussion sessions were held between the frst and last 
author to resolve any discrepancies. This approach helps ensure a 
balance between efciency and human expertise. 
3.3.3 Context and Species Classification. Classifcation of species 
and contexts required careful examination of the roles and envi-
ronments of the animals involved. We categorized the studies into 
six main contexts: Pets/Home, Working Animals, Farm, Zoo, Lab 
Animals, and Wildlife. For example, works on parrots, which were 
often used in both lab and home settings, required careful evalu-
ation to determine the most ftting category. Some contexts were 
multifaceted, especially when the studies had applications in multi-
ple domains. For example, cognitive testing in primates included 
both enrichment in zoo settings and behavioral research in labs. 
Similarly, gait recognition technology in horses could apply to both 
pets and working animals, and fsh technologies could serve both 
preservation and agricultural needs. For such cases, we followed the 
contexts stated by the authors and often tagged with multiple con-
texts to refect intended applications. Species and contexts where 
encoded independently from each others, and their distribution 
within our corpus are represented in Table 1. 
3.3.4 Objectives. Objectives were directly extracted from the au-
thors’ wording and classifed into 12 groups: cognitive enrichment, 
social enrichment, environmental enrichment, physical health, men-
tal health, training, tracking/monitoring, preservation, service/as-
sistance, cognitive/ability testing, human entertainment/education, 
and productivity. Items were often classifed into multiple cate-
gories as they addressed more than one objective. The categoriza-
tions were refned iteratively based on the continuous review and 
discussions among the research team. For example, the category "Cognitive/Ability Testing" was introduced after identifying stud-
ies using screen-based technology purely for cognitive assessment 
rather than enrichment or tracking. The categorization process was 
meticulously managed to ensure consistency, with regular rescreen-
ing and updates to maintain accuracy. In categorizing objectives, 
we paid particular attention to the authors’ stated goals rather than 
inferring additional potential applications. 
3.3.5 Beneficiaries. We screened each item to determine whether 
the authors considered animals as direct benefciaries of the work, 
basing our assessment strictly on the authors’ descriptions. The 
screening of ambiguous cases led to specifc considerations in the 
labeling of benefciaries. 
In some cases, very similar works could be labeled diferently 
based on the authors’ framing. For instance, in the context of health 
monitoring studies, we particularly scrutinized the authors’ word-
ing for work involving young, healthy animals. Health monitor-
ing was not automatically labeled as benefcial, especially in cases 
where it appeared to be conducted primarily for research purposes, 
time-saving for humans, or where healthy outcomes could be en-
sured without the technology, as these instances did not clearly 
state direct or automatic benefts for the animals involved. For ex-
ample, in studies such as those on wearables for dog heart rate 
monitoring, if the authors framed the work based on advantages 
for human handlers, stating, for example, "There is an increasing 
interest from dog handlers and veterinarians in an ability to contin-
uously monitor dogs’ vital signs" or "may yield measurable benefts 
to handlers’ interactions with their dogs" [17], then animals were 
not automatically assumed to be primary benefciaries. 
Some studies presented additional ambiguities, especially when 
introducing stressors or discomfort to animals. We distinguished be-
tween cases where technology was introduced to mitigate existing 
discomfort (for instance, studies on the efect of home technology 
noise on animals) and those where it introduced new stressors 
(such as noise, radio, drones, or robots) to establish the extent to 
which the technology directly addressed their needs versus the 
needs of researchers or human users. Finally, some studies purpose-
fully introduced potential pain, such as with head-fxation or bodily 
pain to build facial marker datasets. These were not automatically 
considered benefcial to the animals involved. 
3.3.6 Feedback. Initially, we aimed to extract information about 
animals’ "understanding" of technology use; however, we recog-
nized the inherent difculties in evaluating such an abstract concept. 
Consequently, we shifted our focus toward assessing sense-making 
from a more objective standpoint—specifcally, the presence of sen-
sory feedback provided to the animal andthe feedback modality 
(visual, tactile, auditory). 
3.3.7 Ethical Considerations in Empirical Testing. Empirically 
tested works were scrutinized for ethical considerations, including 
whether authors reported an Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC), Institutional Review Board (IRB), or other 
institutional ethical approvals. In the United States, IACUCs are es-
tablished by federal mandate at institutions that use live, vertebrate 
animals for research, teaching, and testing activities. The IACUC 
oversees and evaluates all aspects of the institution’s animal care 
Animals’ Entanglement with Technology: a Scoping Review CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
and use program. Our protocol involved searching for specifc key-
words such as "IACUC," "IRB," "approval," "approved," "institutional 
board," "waiver," "ethics," "risk", and "comfort" to determine if ethical 
considerations were addressed and whether this included an ofcial 
review from an external board. We noted a range of adherence to 
ethical guidelines, with some studies explicitly stating compliance 
and others not. 
3.4 Collating, Summarizing, Reporting Results 
We organized our analysis and fndings in three stages, correspond-
ing to our levels of analysis and focus. First, we examined the 
entire corpus (795 papers) to understand its composition in terms 
of general trends, publication venues, geographical afliations, and 
distribution of paper types. This overview provides a broad picture 
of the feld and its evolution. Second, we delved deeper into the 
subcorpus of interactive systems (526 papers). We compared this 
subcorpus to the full corpus to establish whether the balance of 
conceptual vs. applied work was similar across felds and contexts. 
We then analyzed the distribution of target species and examined 
the data in terms of species/context distribution, technology types, 
objectives, and benefciaries, considering both their evolution over 
time and their distribution across diferent animal contexts. Lastly, 
we focused on empirically tested papers, reporting on their ethi-
cal standards and feedback to animals. Based on this analysis, we 
proposed criteria for considering animals as users, types of feed-
back provided, the nature of animal benefts, and empirical testing 
methodologies. Throughout our analysis, we presented quantita-
tive data through descriptive statistics and visualizations, as well 
as qualitative insights from the papers. 
3.5 Limitations 
Despite a comprehensive approach, this review has several limi-
tations. The choice of initial focus on ACM Digital Library may 
have led to the exclusion of relevant work from other felds. While 
this choice anchored our corpus in interaction-focused research, 
it likely skewed our sample towards HCI perspectives. A diferent 
starting point, such as IEEE publications, would have resulted in a 
diferent corpus composition. 
The reliance on published, peer-reviewed, English-language 
work can be expected to introduce potential publication and lan-
guage biases. This may have caused us to overlook insights from 
unpublished studies, works-in-progress, or non-English sources, 
limiting the global representativeness of our fndings. Additionally, 
given the rapid evolution of this feld, our review may not fully cap-
ture the most recent developments due to the lag between research 
conduct and publication - a common challenge for scoping reviews 
using such methodology [4]. 
Further, while the categorization and coding of the papers were 
agreed upon by all authors, we acknowledge the risk of inherent 
human biases as part of this process. We also did not systematically 
evaluate the methodological quality, statistical power, or participant 
details of the studies included in our corpus, as many did not report 
such information, particularly those based on pre-recorded datasets. 
The fnal corpus is by no means all-encompassing, nor did it 
aim to be. It would be beyond the scope of this work to consider 
the entire feld of animal testing using technology or to review all machines used in agriculture. Instead of a systematic review, we 
propose a scoping approach, anchored in HCI work, to help CHI 
researchers, and beyond, situate their work within this landscape. 
Despite these constraints, we believe that this review provides a 
valuable analysis of the landscape of research on animal-technology 
interaction from an HCI perspective. 
4 Overview of the Corpus 
Our analysis shows a strong upward trend in publications, with 
over 81% of the research appearing in the second half of our corpus 
(post-2012) highlighting the important growth in the past decade. 
4.1 Publication venues 
The corpus spans over 200 unique venues, refecting its multidisci-
plinary nature. 46% of the papers are published within the Associa-
tion for Computing Machinery (ACM), with signifcant contribu-
tions from the the ACI and CHI conferences accounting respectively 
for 40% and 14% of ACM-related papers. Other key ACM confer-
ences include the Conference on Advance Computer Entertainment 
(ACE) (23 papers), the Conference on Designing Interactive Systems 
Conference (DIS) (24), and the ACM International Joint Conference 
on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) (15). 
The strong representation of ACM is likely tied to the interaction-
focused nature of the research, and the initial search focus on ACM 
publications. This distribution aligns with the history of ACI as a 
feld, which began as a series of satellite events within other major 
ACM conferences before ACI established itself as a standalone 
conference in 2016. Early ACI papers were often presented at ACE 
and NordiCHI, refecting the evolving visibility of the feld. 
Beyond ACM, the corpus includes contributions from other sig-
nifcant publishing bodies such as the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), which represents 8.9% of the corpus, 
Science Direct (7.2%), Frontiers, and PLOS (1.9%). Individual journals 
with notable representation include "Computers and Electronics in 
Agriculture" (15 papers), "Animals" (13), "Applied Animal Behaviour 
Science" (13), "Journal of Dairy Science" (10), and "Nature" (2). 
4.2 Countries of afliation 
Our corpus includes papers from a total of 54 countries, with domi-
nant representation from the United States (28.46%) and the United 
Kingdom (22.98%), followed by countries such as Australia (8.52%), 
Japan (5.63%), Israel (4.57%) and Canada (4.57%). Compared to the 
overall CHI 2024 submission data used as a proxy for the HCI com-
munity, our corpus is slightly less US-centric (-9 percentage points), 
with a stronger representation from the UK (+ 16 percentage points). 
International collaborations feature prominently, accounting for 
14.6% of the papers. To add context, it is worth viewing these geo-
graphical fndings alongside the Animal Protection Index (API) map 
from World Animal Protection. The API ranks 50 countries based 
on their animal welfare policies, assessed through 10 indicators 
grouped into four goals. This index highlights disparities in global 
animal welfare, providing a backdrop against which the geographi-
cal distribution of our research corpus can be understood both in 
terms of countries where researchers are sensitive to animal rights, 
but also where laws and regulations might be lacking leading to

investigate ways to leverage technology for animals needs. 
4.3 Type of papers 
We categorized the papers into two broad types: conceptual work 
and interactive systems. Conceptual works include position papers 
that discuss theoretical concepts, design methodologies, or ethical 
considerations, without presenting specifc systems. This category 
also encompasses review articles, meta-analyses, and papers intro-
ducing animal-related datasets. Additionally, studies that did not 
engage directly with animals but focused on human perceptions of 
animal technology (e.g., workshops and surveys with caretakers) 
were included as conceptual works. 
Conceptual works constitute 31.3% of our corpus. Emerging 
since 2006, their prevalence has remained relatively stable, com-
prising between 25% and 35% of publications over the past decade. 
These papers are critical for setting the future direction of the feld, 
ofering theoretical insights and framing ethical considerations. 
However, they often lack the granular details on technology types, 
species, and practical implementation needed for a deeper analysis 
of animal-technology entanglements. For a more in-depth analysis, 
we focus on interactive systems and exclude conceptual papers, 
and reviews from our detailed examination of species, technology, 
objectives, and perspectives. 
5 Interactive Systems for/with/on animals 
Papers from ACM venues represented 38.40% of our interactive 
system subcorpus, still a large share but a slightly smaller percent-
age (-7 percentage points) than our full corpus. This indicates that 
ACM presents a higher proportion of conceptual works than other 
venues. The remainder of the "Interactive Systems" works came 
from diverse felds, including farming, biology, animal cognition, 
psychology, engineering, and veterinary sciences, among others. 
5.1 Species representation 
The most represented species in this corpus was dogs, appearing 
in 178 papers (over 35% of the corpus). Dogs were presented as

corpus and in which context the technology developed for 
them was developed. 
intended benefciaries 40% of the time and received feedback on 
the interactions in 40.2% of the cases. These were mostly in the con-
text of pets/home (53%) but were also signifcantly represented as 
working animals (35%) and in lab contexts (2.8%), such as research 
comparing the processing of human emotional faces by pet and lab 
dogs [7]. For pet dogs, we count frequent instances of wearables, 
robot interaction, and mental/physical health monitoring. Systems 
involving working dogs covered many topics often without pro-
viding input to the animals, such as gait detection monitor for sled 
dogs [127] or predicting puppy support dog suitability [26]. How-
ever, some works, particularly those around assistive tools helping 
with job tasks, provided feedback to the animal and required ac-
tive animal engagement such as vibrotactile wearable for hunting 
dogs [113]. 
Cats appeared in 33 papers, all in the context of pets/homes, in-
cluding shelters. The targeted benefciaries of these works were the

cats themselves 28% of the time and they received feedback from 
the technology 40% of the time. Cat-centered systems included loca-
tion wearables for location tracking [155], augmented litter box for 
health monitoring [122] or screen-based interspecies game [161]. 
Non-human primates were also strongly represented with 56 
papers, including 12 on chimpanzees, 7 on gorillas, 5 on marmosets, 
4 on lemurs, 4 on white-faced saki monkeys, 2 on baboons, and 1 
on siamangs. These were exclusively in zoos, lab research, or wild 
and semi-wild environments, often for cognitive/ability testing but 
also enrichment. Overall, 60% of these works presented the animals 
as intended benefciaries often through auditory, screen-based, or 
agency-based enrichment [58]. 
The avian family included 35 papers across all contexts. Most 
predominantly, chickens (18 papers) were often featured in farm-
ing contexts but also appeared in pets/home settings. Nine papers 
focused on eggs-based topics such as fertility detection [30], nest 
attendance [143] and augmented pre-hatching communication [83]. 
Fowls were presented as intended benefciaries 27% of the time. 
Apart from chickens, the avian category included work on various 
species of parrots (14 papers, in both lab and pet contexts) in con-
texts including mediated learning [123] or enrichment [79], pigeons 
(4 papers in lab context), zebra fnches in the context of video voice 
preference [42], penguins with a bubble curtain enrichment [118], 
owls vocalization identifcation [139], and seabirds. These birds 
were considered the targeted benefciaries in 40% of the works. 
We counted 53 papers on cows, with only 13% aiming to beneft 
the animals directly. These papers were mostly in the context of 
farming, focusing on monitoring, calving time prediction, vision 
muzzle detection, and other health, monitoring and productivity 
aspects. There were 20 papers on horses (20% aiming to beneft the 
animals), spread between working animal and pet contexts, mostly 
focusing on monitoring, physical health, and mental health. Ten 
papers on pigs identifed them as benefciaries 27% of the time. 
We counted 50 papers on aquatic animals, including 20 on 
marine mammals, exclusively in wildlife (90%) and zoo/aquarium 
(10%) contexts, with objectives spreading from research [2], to 
preservation [61], interspecies connection [141], cognitive/ability 
testing, enrichment, and human education/entertainment. The re-
maining 30 aquatic non-marine-mammal papers covered aquatic 
animals across pets/home (17%), farms (33%), zoos (20%), wildlife 
(40%), and labs (7%), making them one of the most versatile species 
categories. These works included artistic sonic installation based 
on plankton activity [164], interactive system for straightening 
fsh scans [172], or visual-based monitoring systems to track free-
swimming fsh [94]. 
Elephants were the focus in 12 studies (67% aimed to beneft 
them). Among four lions (2 in the wild and 2 in zoos), only one (a 
feeding and hunting enrichment system for zoos [74]) presented 
the animals as benefciaries, while the 2 girafe studies both stated 
aiming to beneft the animals either through automatic tracking [31] 
or for agency-based audio enrichment [48]. 
We counted 5 papers on insects, including cicadas monitor-
ing [56], cockroaches interaction with robots [49] and two systems 
for bees. Among all insects, only one of the works with bees pre-
sented the animals as benefciaries [149]. Among the least represented species, present in the corpus with 
only one or two items each, were hamsters, hedgehogs, bears, ba-
boons, bats, deer, and camels. 
5.2 Animal contexts 
Figure 6: Timeline distribution of the animal-computing 
work across contexts in our corpus 
Our initial review identifed six main animal context categories: 
Pets/Home, Working Animals, Zoos, Farms, Lab Animals, and 
Wildlife. Due to the limited number of publications in our corpus 
prior 2012, it is difcult to draw clear trends for this period. Focus-
ing on the period after, we observed a mostly stable distribution 
across contexts. However, in the past three years, we note a notice-
able rise in the proportion of papers in the pet/home contexts and 
a decline in lab animal research (Figure 6). These changes in trends 
could refect characteristics of our corpus distribution but also a 
societal shift towards pet technologies or evolving considerations 
regarding lab animals. 
5.2.1 Pets/Home. (31% of papers): This was the most represented 
context with a total of 161 papers, mainly focused on dogs (60.25%) 
and cats (20.50%), but also including birds (8.07%), fsh (3.73%), 
small rodents, reptiles, and even chickens in a domesticated con-
text. Technologies ranged widely from wearable devices (30.72%), 
screen-based systems (29.19%), vision (16.87%) and audio-based 
systems, sensors (25.47%), interactive toys (11.18%), and robots 
(10%). They were mainly designed for monitoring/detecting/track-
ing (43.48%) but also to directly enhance animal physical (14.29%) 
and mental health (19.88%) and facilitate pet-human interaction. 
For instance, papers frequently explored systems that monitor dogs’ 
daily activities, or interactive play devices for cats, highlighting the 
human-animal bond. The bonding aspect was highly present with 
systems designed for interspecies play for instance, emotion/vo-
calization recognition [34], social enrichment using remote tech-
nology with humans [159] robot [126] or remote interaction with 
conspecifcs [57]. The emphasis on pets aligns with growing societal 
interest in enhancing pet care through technology, often aiming to 
improve their quality of life or address behavioral issues. Overhaul 
interactive systems involving pets provided some kind of feedback 
to the animal 41.36% of the time and they were considered direct 
benefciaries 41.98% of the time. 
5.2.2 Farms. (16.4% of corpus): This category, the second most 
represented, primarily focused on livestock such as cows, chickens, 
and pigs. Technologies were predominantly vision-based systems 
(50.59%), sensors and monitoring systems (29.41%), and wearables 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kleinberger et al. 
Figure 7: Graphs showing the distribution of types of objectives (left) and type of technology across the diferent animal 
contexts. 
(20%), refecting the agricultural sector’s adoption of precision farm-
ing techniques. The main objectives were productivity (45.88%), 
tracking/monitoring (29.41%), and physical health (25.88%), with a 
notable absence of mental health or enrichment focus. This distribu-
tion highlights the industry’s emphasis on efciency and physical 
welfare. Animals were considered intended benefciaries in only 
12.94% of the studies, the lowest among all contexts. Examples of 
innovative approaches include automated health monitoring for 
dairy cows [22], vision-based individual identifcation systems [88], 
and egg incubation monitoring [ 154]. Some studies explored more 
advanced technologies, such as virtual fences for controlling cow 
movement [19] and AI-based systems for animal behavior anal-
ysis [105]. This category presents a strong focus on integrating 
productivity with some level of basic animal welfare, refecting the 
challenges and priorities of the sector. 
5.2.3 Working Animals. (15% of corpus): This group included guide 
dogs, search and rescue dogs, therapy animals, military dogs, hunt-
ing dogs, and trained horses. Technologies were almost exclusively 
composed of tracking/monitoring (36.71%) systems and wearables 
(78.48%) [171], which aim to modify the animals existing profes-
sional harnesses. Objective-wise, they often targeted human assis-
tance (54.43%), monitoring (52.56%), with a smaller part of training 
(24.36%), enhancing task performance and productivity (17.95%), 
and tracking physical health (15.38%) [93]. No work reported di-
rectly tackling mental health nor cognitive, social or environmental 
enrichment. This may be attributed to the typically high standard of 
care and stimulation these animals receive as part of their working 
roles and training regimens. The work appeared to be split between 
providing feedback to the animals (51.28% of the time, more than 
for pets) and considering dogs as benefciaries 41.98% of the time. 
Examples of work include auditory cues for guide dogs or vibra-
tional signals during military tasks [140]. Work that did not provide 
feedback to animals includes numerous studies on assessing the 
suitability of puppies to optimize selection for various working 
roles [26], as well as a focus on position and activity monitoring 
to enhance performance [15]. This category stands out for its em-
phasis on technologies that facilitate communication and efciency between the animal and the handler [169], illustrating the role of 
feedback and active animal engagement. 
5.2.4 Zoos/Aquariums. (15.4% of corpus): Most technology-related 
research in zoos in our corpus appears to be carried out with nonhu-
man primates (48. 75%) with much smaller parts for other animals 
such as elephants (10.00%), birds (6.25%), fsh (6.25%), marine mam-
mals (2.50%), bears (2.50%), lions (2.50%), and penguins (2.50%). 
Regarding the type of technology used, the systems were predom-
inantly screen-based systems (50%), audio-based systems (27.5%), 
and interactive toys/objects (28.75%), with a low representation of 
wearables (1.25%). This distribution likely refects the need for non-
invasive, adaptable technologies preferred for the constraints of zoo 
environments. The primary objectives noted were environmental 
enrichment (68.75%), followed by cognitive enrichment (46.25%), 
mental health (28.75%) cognitive/ability testing (26.25%), and preser-
vation (7.50%). Animals were intended as benefciaries in 70% of the 
studies and received direct feedback 75% of the time, ranking the cat-
egory frst in terms of feedback, indicating a strong focus on animal-
agency as a form of enrichment. Examples include sound-based 
enrichment [77], touchscreen tasks for cognitive assessment [68], 
and interactive projections for orangutans [20]. While human en-
tertainment/education was present (8.75%), it didn’t appear as a 
primary focus of the works within our corpus. 
5.2.5 Lab animals. (8.3% of corpus): This category contained pri-
marily non-human primates, rodents, and some avian species such 
as pigeons, parrots, and zebra fnches, using mainly screen-based 
interfaces (58.14%) and audio systems (23.26%). In terms of objective, 
we observe predominantly cognitive and ability testing (79.07%), 
with some accounts of productivity (13.95%) and mental health con-
siderations (11.63%) such as some investigations into music as an 
enrichment tool [112]. While only 9.30% explicitly positioned ani-
mals as benefciaries, a high proportion of studies (74.42%) provided 
feedback to the animals, highlighting the non-automatic correlation 
between the two metrics. 
Animals’ Entanglement with Technology: a Scoping Review CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
5.2.6 Wildlife. (12.1% of corpus): This group covers a diverse range 
of species from marine mammals, birds, land mammals like ele-
phants and agoutis, and insects. Technologies predominantly con-
sisted of visual-based (33.87%), audio-based (32.26%), and sensor-
based monitoring systems (27.42%), with some limited use of wear-
ables (16.13%). The primary objective was tracking and monitoring 
(85.48%), followed by preservation (33.8%) with minor attention 
to productivity (9.68%) and physical health (4.84%). Animals were 
named as immediate benefciaries in 16.13% of studies and received 
direct feedback in 6.45% of cases, the lowest among all contexts. 
This refects the priority of observing natural behaviors with mini-
mal interference. Examples include passive acoustic monitoring of 
cetaceans [9], unmanned aerial vehicle surveys [61], and innovative 
approaches like 3D printed eggs for studying bird behavior [69]. 
Many studies, for wildlife, used machine learning for animal identi-
fcation/monitoring.

mals (in red) and the percentage of papers framing animals 
are benefciaries across animal contexts (top) and across tech-
nology type (bottom) 
5.3 Types of Technologies 
Our review revealed a diverse range of technological types. 
Wearables (27% of the corpus) included, among others, instru-
mented collars for communication or tracking [171], bracelets for 
gait monitoring [22], and harnesses for assistive animals [140]. 
Sensors and monitoring systems (24% of the corpus) were 
used for various purposes, such as passive behavior or health mon-
itoring, including accelerometers for gait analysis [23], automated 
systems for detecting calving time [178], and remote monitoring of 
parturition in dairy cattle [120]. 
Vision-based systems (23%) use cameras and computer vision 
for diverse applications, for example, automated facial recognition 
for non-human primates [173], muzzle pattern recognition for cattle 
identifcation [146], and automated egg fertility detection [95]. Screen-based systems (22%) encompassed various interactive 
screens or tablets, including touchscreen tasks for cognitive assess-
ment in rats [27], problem-solving games for primates [14], and 
interactive projections for orangutans [20]. 
Audio-based systems (14%) involved various sonic inputs 
and/or outputs, such as acoustic whale monitoring [9], auditory 
enrichment for zoo animals [ 132], and vocalization recognition in 
farms [145] and zoos [84]. 
Interactive toys/objects (10%) covered various manipulable 
devices, including but not limited to multi-sensory puzzle for cogni-
tive enrichment [174], robotic toys for pets [176], and enrichment 
devices for primates in managed care [65]. 
Environmental systems (7%) encompassed technological mod-
ifcations to animal habitats, such as automated climate control in 
farming [43], virtual fences for livestock management [19], and 
bubble curtains for aquatic species [118], among others. 
Lastly, robotics (6%) involved various mechanical devices for 
animal interaction, including robotic dogs to study social behav-
ior [176], automated milking systems [62], and robotic enrichment 
devices for zoos [41]. 
Beyond these main categories, several technologies emerged 
in our corpus. These included 3D printed eggs for studying bird 
behavior [38], fMRI for animal research [10], and scent-based 
interfaces for olfactory interactions [55]. 
The distribution of technologies among research objectives re-
veals additional patterns. Wearables and Vision-Based Systems were 
predominantly used for Tracking/Monitoring and Physical Health 
objectives, highlighting their utility in noninvasive data collection. 
Screen-Based Systems showed a strong association with Cognitive 
Enrichment and Cognitive/ability testing. Audio-Based Systems 
were versatile, contributing signifcantly to Cognitive Enrichment, 
Environmental Enrichment, and Tracking/Monitoring. Interactive 
Toys/Objects were primarily used for Cognitive and Environmental 
Enrichment, emphasizing their role in animal engagement. Sensors, 
as expected, were heavily used in Tracking/Monitoring and Physi-
cal Health research. Notably, there seems to be less exploration of 
these technologies in Mental Health and Social Enrichment objec-
tives, suggesting potential areas for future research. The provision 
of feedback to animals varied signifcantly across technology types 
as illustrated in Figure 8 (bottom). 
5.4 Objectives and Benefciaries 
Our results revealed a diverse range of objectives: 
Cognitive Enrichment (12.7% of the corpus) aimed to enhance 
mental stimulation, often through interactive puzzles or games 
with examples including touchscreen tasks for primates [14] and 
cognitive challenges for elephants [41]. This category showed a 
high rate of feedback to animals (85.07%), suggesting a strong focus 
on direct animal engagement. 
Environmental Enrichment (16.6% of the corpus) focused 
on improving animals’ surroundings. This included auditory 
enrichment for gorillas [132] and interactive projections for 
orangutans [20]. With 77.01% of such studies providing feedback to 
animals, this objective often involved active animal participation.

Table 1: Categorization of animal-computer interaction sys-
tems by primary objective: analysis of studies implementing 
direct animal feedback and explicitly stating animals as in-
tended benefciaries (expressed as percentage per category) 
Tracking/Monitoring (49.1% of the corpus) was the most com-
mon objective, involving technologies to observe and record ani-
mal behavior or health. Examples include automated systems for 
detecting calving time in cows [178] and acoustic monitoring of 
whales [9]. Despite being the most prevalent objective, it had a 
low rate of feedback to animals (7.84%), indicating its primarily 
observational approach. 
Physical Health (12.3% of the corpus) studies focused on moni-
toring and improving animal well-being. This included gait analysis 
in cattle [23] and wearable health monitors for dogs [37]. Only 6.25% 
of these studies provided direct feedback to animals, suggesting a 
focus on data collection for human interpretation. 
Cognitive/Ability Testing (15.6% of the corpus) involved as-
sessing animal cognitive capabilities. Examples include touchscreen 
tasks for rats [27] and problem-solving games for birds [66]. With 
74.07% of these studies providing feedback to animals, this objective 
often involved direct animal interaction with the technology. 
Productivity (13.7% of the corpus) studies aimed to enhance 
efciency in contexts like farming. Examples include automated 
milking systems [62] and egg fertility detection [95]. Only 23.94% 
of these studies provided feedback to animals, refecting a focus on 
human-oriented outcomes. 
Human Entertainment/Education 4.20% of the corpus con-
cerned works incorporating animals for human learning or enjoy-
ment. This included artistic endeavours such as the sonifcation 
of a fsh tank [111], or an immersive experience of animal sensing 
data for education [85]. 
Preservation (5.34% of the corpus) included studies and sys-
tems aimed at animal preservation and conservation in various 
contexts, for instance by aiming to sensitize zoo audiences to great 
ape endangerment [167] or using monitoring tools such as drones 
for surveying marine fauna to protect dugongs [61]. 
Our results reveal varying degrees of animal engagement across 
diferent research objectives in terms of feedback received by the 
animals and their consideration as benefciaries, as illustrated in Ta-
ble1. We observe some disparity across objectives, such as Physical Health where animals are considered benefciaries but not given 
feedback, or Cognitive/Ability Testing where the inverse trend is 
seen. This highlights potential opportunities for developing more 
interactive approaches in areas traditionally focused on passive 
data collection, particularly in Tracking/Monitoring and Physi-
cal Health research. It also suggests a need for greater alignment 
between providing feedback to animals and considering them as 
primary benefciaries of the research across all objectives. 
5.5 Feedback 
Our analysis revealed that out of all the papers in our corpus, only 
38.05% provided some form of feedback to animals. This feedback 
was predominantly visual (63.32% of feedback papers), followed 
by tactile (30.65%) and audio (27.64%) feedback. Olfactory feed-
back was rarely used, appearing in only 1.01% of papers providing 
feedback. This distribution highlights the prevalence of visual inter-
faces in ACI, but also suggests potential opportunities for exploring 
other sensory modalities, particularly olfactory feedback, due to its 
importance in many animals’ sensory worlds. 
We observed that while there is some overlap between papers 
providing feedback to animals and those considering animals as 
benefciaries, these metrics are not entirely aligned as seen in Fig-
ure 8 (top). This discrepancy supports the idea of pairing these 
two metrics when considering animals as users of technology. For 
instance for lab animals there is often feedback 74.42% even if they 
are considered benefciaries only 9.3% of the time. 
5.6 Empirical testing and ethics 
Amongst interactive systems described in the corpus, 76.91% were 
empirically tested with animals beyond the use of pre-existing and 
pre-recorded datasets. For these 403 studies, we examined mentions 
of ethics and report of approval (or waiver) from Institutional Ani-
mal Care and Use Committees (IACUC or equivalents). Although 
64.23% mention ethical considerations, less than half (47.53%) re-
ported review from an ofcial board, the animal context most fre-
quently reporting ofcial institutional review and approval was 
labs (60. 53%) followed by working animals (48.57%), pets/home 
(46.90%), farming (36.96%) and fnally wildlife with only 27.27%. 
We explored the potential correlation between geographical 
location and the reporting of IACUC approval, considering that 
ethical review practices could vary due to cultural and regulatory 
diferences across countries. The data reveals noticeable diferences 
across countries: Denmark stands out as the only country where 
all studies reported ethical approval, refecting a stringent adher-
ence to ethical review protocols. In contrast, other countries dis-
played a mixed pattern, with most ranging between 30% and 60% 
of studies reporting IACUC approval. This variability highlights 
inconsistencies in how ethical considerations are handled, even 
within countries that frequently mention ethical aspects of their 
research. Notably, some countries show signifcant gaps between 
studies that mention ethical considerations and those that explicitly 
report IACUC approval, suggesting that ethical considerations do 
not always translate into formal review or that diferent standards 
might be applied. These fndings underscore the need for more 
consistent and transparent reporting of ethical approvals across 
the feld. 
Animals’ Entanglement with Technology: a Scoping Review CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan 
6 Discussion 
Our analysis of nearly 800 research works maps the landscape of 
animal-technology research and reveals insights for future devel-
opment. Following methodological approaches from previous HCI 
reviews [92, 110, 117], we identify several core themes emerging 
from our analysis: (1) the persistence of context-specifc silos, (2) a 
proposed framework of animal usership, (3) approaches to ethics 
and research challenges, and (4) the multifaceted intersections be-
tween ACI and HCI. Through examining these themes, we develop 
concrete recommendations and practical steps for experienced ACI 
researchers and HCI practitioners looking to expand their work to 
include animals, while acknowledging the feld’s complexity and 
evolving nature. 
6.1 Context-Specifc Technologies, Evolution 
and Research Silos 
This review provides, to our knowledge, the frst cross-contextual 
analysis of animal-technology research from an HCI lens, reveal-
ing how diferent contexts have evolved distinct technological and 
interactional approaches. This bird’s-eye view enables us to iden-
tify patterns of specialization across diferent animal contexts that 
might not be apparent when examining each domain in isolation. 
Temporal analysis also reveals an evolving landscape. In recent 
years, we see an increase in pet-focused technologies, while the 
ratio of research involving farm animals, laboratory animals, and 
wildlife appears to be declining in empirical deployment. This shift 
might refect easier access to pet subjects and ethical constraints 
of involving wild animals. Yet, it also raises concerns about ne-
glecting animals that might be most in need of technological inter-
vention. This trend toward pet technologies, while expanding our 
understanding of companion animal needs, risks creating a two-
tier system of animal-technology research where some animals 
receive more user-centered consideration than others. Farm and 
laboratory animals, in particular, remain underrepresented in terms 
of cognitive and social enrichment technologies, with our analy-
sis showing only 12.94% of farming-context studies considering 
animals as intended benefciaries. 
Based on the corpus analysis, we identifed some prototyp-
ical and strongly represented combinations of objectives and 
technologies for each context. Figure 9 shows the prevalence of 
each technology used, and each objective targeted across animal 
contexts. The most common practices that can be summarized as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• • Toys & robots for physical/mental health & bonding with 
pets 
Wearables for training & tracking working animals 
Screens and audio-based technologies for enrichment in 
zoos 
Screen-based cognitive testing for lab animals 
Acoustic monitoring for wildlife tracking and preservation 
Vision-based systems to monitor the physical health to in-
crease productivity in farms These patterns reveal not just technological preferences but fun-
damentally diferent assumptions about animals’ roles and needs 
across contexts - from pets as companions deserving enrichment to 
farm animals primarily as production units. These context-specifc 
approaches mirror early HCI’s tendency to develop specialized 
solutions for diferent workplace environments, before broader 
user-centered principles emerged that crossed contextual bound-
aries [11]. 
These silos appear to arise from multiple factors and to refect 
practical constraints. For instance, wildlife research often requires 
large-scale monitoring in remote locations, potentially explain-
ing the prevalence of acoustic and vision-based systems. Others 
might stem from established research traditions: laboratory ani-
mal studies typically follow standardized protocols inherited from 
behavioral research and animals often have to stay on single proto-
cols. Economic factors can also play a role as farms may prioritize 
productivity-enhancing technologies, while zoo environments may 
invest in enrichment to address stereotypical behaviors. This may 
also refect the structure of academic and industry research com-
munities, where limited cross-pollination between animal behavior 
researchers, veterinary technologists, and HCI practitioners rein-
forces context-specifc approaches. 
Yet the corpus also reveals promising examples that transcend 
these contextual boundaries. Buchanan-Smith and Badihi’s [18] 
work on environmental control for laboratory marmosets demon-
strates how principles of agency and choice - more commonly 
considered in pet or zoo contexts - can enhance laboratory animal 
welfare. Similarly, Chiu et al.’s [25] emotion detection system for 
elephants applies techniques typically used in pet contexts to other 
scenarios. Hauser et al.’s [54] research on accessible dog toys shows 
how considering non-working activities for service animals can 
enrich both animal and human experience. 
These cross-context successes suggest opportunities for more 
diverse technological approaches. While institutional access re-
strictions, methodological diferences, and varying ethical review 
requirements present real challenges to crossing contextual bound-
aries, here we suggests concrete steps that researchers could con-
sider to bridge these gaps: 
⇒ Familiarize themselves with technologies and approaches 
used across diferent animal contexts to identify potential 
tools and methods beyond their immediate feld 
⇒ Explore opportunities to adapt successful approaches from 
other contexts while respecting domain-specifc constraints 
⇒ Consider how technologies might be extended or combined 
across species and contexts 
⇒ Acknowledge and critically examine context-specifc as-
sumptions about animal capabilities and needs 
⇒ Seek collaborations across diferent animal research domains 
to bridge methodological gaps 
The observed cross-context patterns raise questions about how 
we conceptualize animals’ roles in technological interventions. 
While some contexts position animals as active participants, oth-
ers treat them primarily as subjects of observation. This variation 
suggests the need for a more structured way to think about animal 
engagement with technology and when to consider them users vs 
subjects of technology research.

6.2 Understanding Animals as Users: A 
Framework 
As discussed in sections 2.3 and 2.4, the question of usership in 
the context of interactive technology research remains contentious 
in both HCI, and ACI. Based on corpus analysis and building on 
user-centered design principles, we propose a framework to help re-
searchers think about animals’ roles in technological interventions. 
Refecting on the various ways animals engage with technology 
in our corpus, we identify three key criteria to help frame the con-
cept: feedback, benefts and empirical testing. Each criterion 
addresses a diferent aspect of user interaction. Provision of sensory 
feedback to the animals, while not guaranteeing comprehension, 
provides the basic foundation for animals to make connections be-
tween their actions and system responses and acknowledge animal 
agency. Framing animals as intended benefciaries ensures there is 
fundamental motivation for the interaction beyond human or re-
search needs. Empirical testing moves beyond theoretical proposals 
to validate whether and how animals actually engage with the sys-
tem in practice. While no single criterion fully captures the concept 
of "user," together these three parameters ofer a structured way to 
conceive animal agency and engagement in mediated interventions. 
The distribution of these criteria across our corpus reveals addi-
tional patterns, as seen in Figure 10. While 82.1% of studies conduct 
empirical testing, only 38.0% provide direct feedback to animals, 
and just 36.1% frame animals as primary benefciaries. All in all, 
only 22.71% of studies meet all three criteria. These proportions 
have remained relatively stable over the past 20 years, generally 
ranging between 10% and 30%, suggesting persistent patterns in 
how researchers approach animal-technology interaction. 
The framework reveals marked variations across contexts: zoo 
settings lead with 55% of studies meeting all criteria, while farm (1.18%), laboratory (6.98%), and wildlife (1.61%) settings rarely po-
sition animals as users. These patterns refect not just practical 
constraints but assumptions about animals’ roles in diferent set-
tings. Zoo environments, focused on enrichment and welfare, may 
more naturally align with user-centered approaches. However, suc-
cessful examples across all contexts demonstrate the framework’s 
potential value even in challenging settings. For instance, cognitive 
adaptation feeding systems for pigs [33] show that farm animals can 
engage as users through audio feedback and control over feeding, 
while research on lab animals’ control over their environment [18] 
shows how they can be given meaningful agency. 
Some limitations and complexities in our framework warrant 
critical examination. Our classifcation of animals as benefciaries 
relies on authors’ explicit statements, which may refect varying 
standards across felds or overstate potential benefts - a particular 
concern in HCI venues where impact claims are standard practice. 
Moreover, as Williams [170] demonstrates, even systems that ac-
knowledge animal cognition and agency can be coopted to optimize 
control rather than enhance welfare. The presence of feedback or 
empirical testing alone does not guarantee meaningful engagement 
or beneft. This framework should therefore serve not as a checklist 
for ethical practice, but as a tool to think critically about how we 
position animals in technological research. 
While this framework aligns with a movement from designing 
"on" animals to designing "for" animals, we also acknowledge its 
ethical limitations. Recognizing animal sentience and agency can 
paradoxically serve to refne rather than challenge instrumental 
approaches to animal research [170]. The presence of feedback, em-
pirical testing, and stated benefts - while important considerations -
do not automatically equate to ethical or good research. This frame-
work aims to provide a structured way to examine how we position

Figure 10: Diagram of Animals Technology Usership Framework, and its representation within the corpus. 
animals in technological research while remaining mindful of the 
broader implications of these positions. This aligns with critical 
animal studies’ emphasis on examining not just individual practices 
but their role in broader systems of human-animal relationships. 
For researchers considering this framework, we recommend the 
following practical considerations: 
⇒ Consider whether animals should be positioned as users in 
the system - this may not be necessary or appropriate for all 
technological interventions 
⇒ Identify feedback modalities that align with both species-
specifc sensory capabilities and contextual constraints 
⇒ Document clear pathways between system design and in-
tended animal benefts 
⇒ Design validation methods that can meaningfully assess ani-
mal engagement 
⇒ Acknowledge implementation challenges while working to 
address them 
⇒ Refect critically on how your research positions animals 
within broader systems of human-animal relationships, be-
yond immediate welfare considerations 
With its concrete criteria, this framework contributes to on-
going discussions about animal agency while ofering practical 
guidance for researchers. While aligning with HCI’s emphasis on 
user-centered design, it acknowledges the unique challenges of 
working with non-human participants and the complex ethical, 
practical, and legal considerations. 
6.3 Ethics and Research Challenges 
The ethical dimensions of animal-technology research present com-
plex challenges that parallel HCI’s own evolution. Just as HCI’s 
adoption of formal human subject protections in the 1990s estab-
lished research standards [151], our analysis reveals growing at-
tention to ethical considerations. Among studies involving live 
animal participants (excluding pre-recorded datasets), 64.23% dis-
cuss ethical considerations, yet only 47.53% report formal institu-
tional review board approval. This discrepancy between ethical discussion and formal oversight may refect geographical or cul-
tural diferences, misalignment in reporting standards or challenges 
in obtaining institutional approval. 
Understanding this gap becomes particularly important given 
the potential negative impacts of technology on animal subjects, 
and it appears to vary across contexts. Laboratory animal research 
shows the highest rate of institutional review (60.53%), possibly due 
to studies conducted outside standard protocols or variations in 
reporting practices. Wildlife studies report the lowest rate (27.27%), 
refecting the prevalence of "passive monitoring" approaches where 
researchers don’t provide direct feedback to animals. However, 
even such observational approaches, particularly those involving 
audio playbacks or tracking devices, can signifcantly impact animal 
behavior and social structures [101, 119]. While the U.S. mandates 
IACUC oversight, other countries have varying requirements for 
animal research review. 
Thus, obtaining institutional approval can present challenges, 
particularly for novel technological interventions. Traditional eth-
ical approval boards may be unfamiliar with new technologies 
or interaction paradigms, while researchers working with pets or 
wildlife may struggle to ft their work into oversight frameworks 
designed primarily for laboratory research. These challenges can 
be of concern given potential negative impacts of technology even 
in managed care situations. Indeed, some studies deliberately intro-
duce stressors to observe animal responses - for instance, research 
measuring stress efects of drones or robots on pet behavior [36], 
or studies involving induced pain for developing facial expression 
recognition systems [128]. While such work may aim to beneft 
broader animal populations (like developing better pain detection 
tools), it raises ethical questions about balancing population bene-
fts against an individuals welfare. 
Moreover, even when studies emphasize care practices, this alone 
may not ensure ethical conduct. As Giraud and Hollin [45] demon-
strate in their analysis of laboratory beagle research, care practices 
can sometimes reinforce rather than challenge experimental ob-
jectives. Their work reveals how care can be used to manufacture 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kleinberger et al. 
compliance rather than create genuine ethical transformation, po-
tentially facilitating rather than preventing the instrumentalization 
of research subjects. This tension extends beyond care practices to 
broader questions about technological interventions - what Manzini 
terms "remedial goods" - where improvements in immediate con-
ditions might inadvertently legitimize rather than transform chal-
lenging contexts [102]. 
This creates multiple intersecting tensions that ACI researchers 
must navigate: between care and ethics, between immediate im-
provements and systemic change, and between oversight and re-
search accessibility. While technological interventions may ofer 
real benefts for animals in challenging situations, we must simul-
taneously examine whether our work risks making problematic 
practices more palatable rather than promoting necessary systemic 
changes. Yet, pursuing only systemic transformation might mean 
missing opportunities to improve animals’ immediate welfare - a 
practical reality that researchers working directly with animals 
must face. 
This landscape presents a critical challenge: how to maintain 
high ethical standards while ensuring research remains accessible 
to diverse voices and perspectives. The challenges in navigating 
oversight mechanisms might inadvertently exclude valuable contri-
butions, particularly from practitioners working with animals in 
non-traditional research settings. Yet, lowering ethical standards 
risks compromising animal welfare. Our analysis suggests the need 
for a balanced approach that acknowledges both the value and 
limitations of technological interventions while developing more 
fexible, context-appropriate review mechanisms. This is particu-
larly relevant as the feld expands to include researchers working 
with companion animals, wildlife conservation eforts, and techno-
logical enrichment in various settings. 
⇒ Establish early relationships with institutional review boards 
to bridge understanding of novel technologies 
⇒ Partner with institutions having established animal research 
protocols 
⇒ Document and evaluate potential risks and benefts for both 
targeted population and individual participants 
⇒ Adapt human subjects research principles where appropriate 
⇒ Understand specifc regulations in your region and country 
⇒ Consider how tech interventions might balance immediate 
welfare needs with potential systemic impacts 
As animal-technology research expands beyond traditional lab-
oratory settings, the community needs to develop more adapted 
approaches to ethical oversight that can accommodate diverse con-
texts while ensuring animal welfare. 
6.4 The Multifaceted Relevance of ACI to HCI 
Our review reveals a complex and multifaceted relationship be-
tween the domains of ACI and HCI. While both felds show evolu-
tionary patterns in time, their relationship is not linear and forms 
an intricate web of interconnections. Our corpus reveals that most 
animal technology work remains siloed within specifc contexts 
(pets, working animals, farm animals, etc.), refecting a stage similar 
to HCI’s second wave’s "well-established communities of practice." 
This suggests that ACI might be poised for its own transition to-
ward broader considerations of animal experience with technology, independent of their prescribed roles in human society, as possi-
bly already suggested by the recent rise of the more-than-human 
movement [ 138]. However, achieving this would require overcom-
ing research biases about diferent categories of animals and their 
relationships to technology. 
The non-linear nature of this relationship becomes particularly 
apparent when examining methodological developments. While 
HCI began with robust model-driven approaches (e.g., Fitts’ Law, 
cognitive modeling) likewise early ACI work like Skinner’s operant 
conditioning chambers [148] similarly emphasized systematic re-
search. However, basic ergonomic considerations for animal bodies 
existed in some form since the 1980s’ [121], but have only recently 
received more traction when researchers begun investigating more 
fundamental interaction principles for animals, such as ergonomics 
work on button design for dogs [136] or studies examining Fitts’ 
Law with diferent species [79]. In addition to this temporal evo-
lution, we identifed eight distinct ways in which ACI and HCI 
intersect and contribute to each other (see Figure 11). 
6.4.1 Human-in-the-Loop: A primary way that HCI and ACI in-
tersect emerges from our analysis of research benefciaries. Most 
animals in our corpus exist within managed care environments, 
making their human caretakers/owners/handlers integral to any 
technological intervention. Our analysis reveals a wide range of 
human benefciaries: veterinarians using health data [153, 163], 
zookeepers managing enrichment systems [77, 131], and pet own-
ers engaging with their companions [ 158, 161]. This human-in-the-
loop reality means that technology must often be considered across 
species. Researchers should consider how their technologies create 
interfaces that work within existing human-animal pairs. 
6.4.2 Multispecies Interconnectedness: Besides the animal depen-
dence on humans, our corpus also reveals that many systems, par-
ticularly in farming and working animal contexts, recognize that it 
is not only animals relying on humans but also humans relying on 
animals. This interdependence is exemplifed in context of working 
dog and assistance animals [134, 137], where systems aim to sup-
port the animals in providing support to humans, recognizing the 
need to support both members of the working team. This is also 
evident in the farming context [125, 156], where our dependence on 
animals informs the technology we use with them. In this context 
humans can also often be considered users and benefciaries of 
animal technologies. 
6.4.3 Methodological Innovation: Beyond the direct user and bene-
fciary relationships, ACI is relevant to HCI through its innovative 
methodological frameworks. With only a minority of systems that 
provide feedback to animals, researchers had to develop alternative 
evaluation approaches for participants who cannot clearly express 
preferences or provide direct feedback about their experience. For 
instance, Cheok et al.’s [24] evaluation methodology combined 
voluntary engagement patterns and health metrics to assess their 
mixed-reality system’s impact on hamsters, demonstrating how 
multiple indirect measures could provide robust evidence of user 
experience. Similarly, Mancini et al.’s [100] semiotic framework 
analyzed how dogs interpreted tracking devices through their con-
textualized behaviors, ofering insights into how users make sense 
of technology through natural interactions. These methodological

Figure 11: Multifaceted intersections of HCI and ACI subdomain in a temporal and non-linear manner based on the HCI wave 
framework (left), and base on the eight categories emerging from the current analysis 
innovations could inform approaches to designing for any user 
group where traditional feedback mechanisms are challenging, for 
instance non-verbal individuals or those unfamiliar with technol-
ogy. Although this parallel requires careful ethical consideration. 
6.4.4 Physiological Diversity in Interface Design: The challenges of 
designing for diverse animal bodies and capabilities have prompted 
ACI research to consider fundamental questions about interface 
adaptation. Our corpus showed varied approaches across species, 
from vision-based systems (23%) to wearables (27%) to screen-based 
interfaces (22%) most of them adapted in a bespoke manner to 
the animals’ unique bodies. Recent work examining interaction 
principles for animals, such as Robinson et al.’s investigation of 
dog-appropriate button design [136], demonstrates how designing 
for diferent physiologies and sensory abilities can advance our 
understanding of interface adaptation. This approach to extreme 
personalization resonates with HCI’s growing focus on designing 
for diverse human bodies and abilities from people with physical 
disabilities [144] to athletes [109], suggesting that insights from an-
imal interface design could inform more inclusive human interface 
design. 
6.4.5 Environmental Impact and Sustainability: Some of our cor-
pus explicitly addresses preservation goals, contributing signif-
cantly to HCI’s growing focus on environmental sustainability. 
From wildlife monitoring technologies [86, 114] to sustainable farm-
ing practices [46, 149], ACI work often grapples with questions of 
environmental impact. The inclusion of animal perspectives in tech-
nology design aligns with recent calls in sustainable HCI to move 
beyond human-centric approaches [108], suggesting that ACI’s 
methods could contribute to developing more systemic understand-
ings of environmental challenges. This resonates with emerging 
discussions in the CHI community about expanding sustainable HCI to consider non-human actors and biodiversity [107], posi-
tioning animal-technology research as a valuable contributor to 
imagining sustainable futures. 
6.4.6 Evolutionary Understanding of Interaction: The study of 
animal-technology may provide insights into fundamental aspects 
of tool use and interaction. From primates using tablets [68] to fsh 
interfacing with digital systems [70], a comparative approach helps 
illuminate basic principles of interaction that transcend species 
boundaries and may shed light on deeper shared capabilities of 
ancestral living creatures. As McGrath [103] notes, this can deepen 
our understanding of interaction itself. Our corpus reveals numer-
ous instances where technologies developed for one species fnd 
applications in others [76]. This pattern of knowledge transfer be-
tween species contexts suggests fundamental interaction principles 
that could inform human interface design. 
6.4.7 Ethics and Post-human Perspectives: 64.23% of studies men-
tioned ethical considerations refecting which echoes the recent 
rise of the “more-than-human” approaches. As Mancini argues, ACI 
research fundamentally challenges anthropocentric assumptions 
about technology design [96]. This aligns with HCI’s fourth wave 
emphasis on post-human perspectives [35] and ethical comput-
ing [67], suggesting that ACI’s animal-centered design principles 
could inform broader discussions about ethical technology devel-
opment. 
6.4.8 Designing for Otherness: Perhaps most fundamentally, ACI 
research challenges our assumptions about what it means to design 
for users who are diferent from ourselves. Our corpus shows how 
researchers approaching animal users provide avenues to question 
assumptions about interaction, preferences, and needs. This explicit 
recognition of designing for "otherness" aligns with HCI’s core 
principle of user-centered design, as articulated by Dix [29], where 
the “focus must be on real users in real situations, however diferent 
CHI ’25, April 26–May 01, 2025, Yokohama, Japan Kleinberger et al. 
they might be from the designers”. The empirical testing of animal 
technologies in our corpus leads to unexpected patterns of use and 
interaction, challenging researcher assumptions from zoo animals 
using interfaces to attract visitors [78, 82], to farm animals enjoying 
the experience of being pet remotely [157]. These approaches to 
designing for radical diferences can serve as a valuable exercise 
of empathy to empower animals with rich experience and humans 
with extended perspectives on sharing the Earth with others. 
7 Conclusion 
Animals’ interaction with technology is multifaceted, ofering a 
wide range of applications across research felds, contexts, and 
species for diferent motivations. Through an analysis of nearly 
800 research works, our scoping review highlights a strong interest 
but also great disparities. With particular focus on bonding with 
pets, enriching zoo animals, tracking working animals, monitoring 
wildlife, and testing lab animals, the feld is marked with gaps and 
paved with opportunities to extend welfare across contexts. By ele-
vating animals as users of technology rather than mere subjects, our 
proposed framework aims to help researchers situate their work 
within this dynamic and multidisciplinary landscape. Our work 
illuminates the complex entanglement between animals and tech-
nology—a nexus that demands ethical vigilance yet ofers potential 
for informing our shared future. 
Dataset and Interactive Platform 
To allow researchers to further engage with the corpus and our en-
coding, we provide an interactive paper explorer platform online at 
https://fndapaper.interactanimallab.com This platform is intended 
as a living project, where we welcome community contributions 
and updates. The full dataset underlying this analysis will be made 
publicly available for download. For access to the full dataset and 
classifcation, please contact us at contact@interactanimallab.com.
