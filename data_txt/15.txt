ABSTRACT
In the era of blurring boundaries between technology and humans,
the idea of posthumanism in the arts offers opportunities to over-
come human natural limitations through the integration of artificial
agents that can enhance performance and creativity. Within the
field of dance, a variety of technologies have been utilized to am-
plify aspects such as training, artistic creation, live performance,
and dance archives. Nonetheless, a largely unexplored territory
exists—the application of emerging technology in the context of
disability dance. This paper presents an ongoing project focused
on gesture-controlled AI generation for wheelchair dance as a way
to explore the complex relationship between dancers and their
assistive devices. The system uniquely captures the dancer and
wheelchair through body segmentation, then recombines them into
a unified body. Subsequently, it extracts movement features based
on the previously established framework for visualizing movement
quality in wheelchair dance, generating images that enable a deeper
understanding of the dance’s expressive qualities. This innovative
approach enhances the creative potential of wheelchair dance, em-
powering dancers to craft personalized visual narratives.

1 INTRODUCTION
The rapid development of technologies and tools that seem to alter
or outright replace human functions has sparked a fear of integra-
tion with artificial technologies [ 11]. In searching for an alternative
path from the idea of technology as a substitute for human ability,
the concept of posthumanism centered on integration with tech-
nology as a way to disrupt the separate dichotomies of users vs
artifacts, as well as the subversion of societal norms [ 5]. Within the
disability community, and especially among disabled artists, there
is often more awareness of this tension as assistive tools have been
perceived both as potentially eclipsing the user’s own identity and
as a means to express it [1].
Experiments on posthumanism are frequently observable within
the realm of dance. These endeavors encompass the utilization of
visual design to extend the temporal-spatial capacities of the human
body [ 2,3,13] or enhance the ephemeral dynamic of dance [ 10].
Dance, as an art form inherently rooted in human characteristics,
serves as a medium for the transformation of implicit body schema
into explicit embodiment.
Moreover, the visualization of dance transcends inherent phys-
ical limitations to facilitate extensive storytelling, aligning with
the principles of posthumanism, wherein technology is harnessed
to augment human attributes and re-negotiate the body itself [ 7].
Contemporary approaches to visualizing dance have delved into the
augmentation of creativity [ 2], performance enhancement [ 4,10],
and training refinement[ 8]. Nevertheless, the exploration of dance
visualization within the framework of posthumanism remains no-
tably absent in the context of wheelchair dance, which is arguably
more suited to it as a result of the natural integration between the
human body of the dancer and the technological extension of the
wheelchair.
In wheelchair dance, assistive tools can boost dancers’ abilities
but may also highlight their disability, possibly overshadowing their
artistic identity [ 1]. Recent research has tackled this by visualizing
expressive qualities in wheelchair dance, drawing from established
movement methods to combat such stigma [ 13]. However, the solu-
tion by Xie et al 2023 [ 13] lacks adaptable visual narratives captur-
ing the dynamic dancer-tool relationship that exists in wheelchair

dance. This research expands on the existing framework of move-
ment quality visualization for wheelchair dance [ 13], integrating
generative AI within the overarching posthumanist ideology to
explore adaptive visualizations tailored specifically to wheelchair
dance’s identity.
2 RELATED WORKS
To examine the integration of posthumanism in dance visualiza-
tion for disabled dancers and assistive technology, we conducted
a literature review spanning three different domains: Embodied ,
Incorporated , and Cybernetic . We selected these domains to provide
a structured framework for our investigation, allowing us to sys-
tematically analyze how disability dance and assistive technology
intersect and evolve in these diverse dimensions. This structured
approach informs our design considerations, focusing on the inter-
action between the disabled body and the wheelchair.
•Embodied In this research’s context, embodied underscores
the emphasis on our biological body and visualizing dance
while maintaining a strong connection to our natural form.
Such visualizations can be controlled by audiences’ physio-
logical feedback [ 10], participatory designed visual mapping
[8], or dance trajectory generated avatar [ 2]. The focus is to
enhance dancers’ movement creation through varied design
processes and visualizations. Sound-motion mapping has
been employed for AI dance generation to bolster adaptabil-
ity [12]. Yet, the potential of this approach remains unex-
plored in text-image generation and among disabled dancers.
•Incorporeal Under posthumanism the idea of incorporeal en-
compasses the existence beyond the limitation of the natural
body, which transcends to a new form of being, such as a dig-
ital identity. Research that visualizes wheelchair dancers’ ex-
pressive quality based on Laban Movement Analysis (LMA)
for both wheelchair dancers and non has attempted to create
a visual state of being that is not bounded by the specific char-
acteristics of the body [ 9,13]. These visualizations embody
posthumanism’s core principles by transcending physical
limitations to digital narrative.
•Cybernetic This concept explores the idea that humans can
merge with or become closely connected to technologies or
machines, blurring the line between the human body and
inhuman objects. In Oscar Schlemmer’s Bauhaustänze , ex-
ternal tools such as costumes and geometrical poles were
integrated to extend movement capacity towards the exte-
rior space [ 3]. Although this is not digital visualization, the
visual perception of costume and tools integrated cybernetic
elements within the dance experience.
Dance visualization can derive from each mentioned category to
practice the idea of posthumanism. Our research finds that while
progress has been made in enhancing dance visualization, there
remains a notable gap in developing adaptable visual narratives that
fully represent the dynamic interaction between disabled dancers
and their assistive tools. Since disability has its unique difference
based on each case, it requires end-user adaptable visualization
for wheeling dancers [ 13]. On the other hand, the positioning of
wheelchairs in wheelchair dance visualization is yet to be examined
and explored.3 DESIGN DEVELOPMENT
3.1 Concept
This research focuses on integrating posthumanist approaches and
adaptable visualization, categorizing posthumanism into three di-
mensions: the natural body, external body, and assisted body, cor-
responding to embodied ,incorporeal , and cybernetic , drawing from
the choreutics concept of the kinesphere within the dancer’s body,
the wheelchair, and their amalgamation.
Within adaptive visualization, we explore the dancer’s control
over the visualization process, referencing the systematic frame-
work outlined in "Movement Quality Visualization for Wheelchair
Dance" (Xie, 2023), utilizing extracted movement features to trigger
visual content creation. Integrating AI generation enhances the
dynamic and diverse visual language, elevating the visualization
process and broadening the scope of visual expression.
3.2 Embodied, Incorporeal, and Cybernetic
The wheelchair dance movement is captured through video data in-
put which facilitates both real-time and post-processing conditions.
The video data is analyzed within the TouchDesigner platform,
focusing on a four-second segment of movements. This analysis
utilizes MediaPipe for the segmentation of predefined data within
the original video content, including the body morphology. The
aim is to identify three fundamental elements of the distinct and
interconnected kinesphere:
•Embodied This category considers the dancer’s own individ-
ual body. Machine learning directly segments the dancer’s
natural body from video input as the main target for embod-
iedvisualization (Figure 1).
•Incorporeal Wheelchair is considered as the incoporeal body.
Segmentation of the wheelchair is not directly processed
with machine learning. The system’s post-processing masks
previously segmented dancers’ bodies on original video data
to extract the wheelchair (Figure 1).
•Cybernetic The combination of dancer’s body and wheelchair
together makes cybernetic body. Uniting the previously ex-
tracted dancer’s body and wheelchair, the system is able
to present a visual amalgamation of two different bodies
together.
Each individual piece of extracted visual data will function as the
foundational input guiding the AI generation process, encompass-
ing the distinct categories of embodied ,incorporeal , and cybernetic .
3.3 Adaptive Control for Visualization
The AI generation from Stable Diffusion is accessed by connect-
ing to an external application programming interface (API). The
process of AI generation necessitates prompts to govern the vi-
sual output, and for the purpose of controlling visualization in this
project, movement expression is employed to manipulate prede-
fined prompt inputs. Xie’s proposed solution [ 13] offers a method
for handling extracted movement data grounded in LMA’s Effort
theory. LMA is an established movement analysis system, and its
Effort theory examines movement quality into two opposite con-
tinuums from each motion factor [ 6]. Our proposed system uses
extracted movement data from Effort theory’s Weight and Time to

reconfigure movement data as the control factor to switch prompt
input. The system demonstrates the capacity to employ existing
solutions for motion-controlled to prompt input, thereby providing
a platform for adaptive AI generation with integrated movement
expressions.
3.3.1 Weight. In Effort theory, Weight signifies the force magni-
tude expressed by a dancer through body extension, encapsulating
two qualities: "strong" and "light." As the body extends, Weight
is perceived as "light," while the opposite denotes "strong". The
current solution employs the identification of body extension by
measuring the distance between the upper limbs and the nose to
the constructed wheelchair center [ 13]. Our system calculates the
average body extension values over a cumulative process, deter-
mining the points at which Weight is at its strongest or lightest,
assigning two prompts to align with the maximum and minimum
body extension values, and facilitating prompt input control based
on the Weight quality of movements.
In the concept of Incorporeal , the system takes the extracted
wheelchair as an image guide and generates visuals according to the
preassigned prompts of "dark" and "bright" correspond to Weight’s
"strong" and "light" (Figure 2). Additionally, two constant prompts,
"human body" and "dancehall", control the invariant visual condi-
tion.
3.3.2 Time. According to the LMA Effort theory, Time represents
the duration of motion, incorporating the qualities of movement
denoted as "sustained" and "sudden," with "sustained" relating to
slower motion and "sudden" to faster motion. In Xie’s proposed
solution, Time is quantified by extracting the speed of upper limb
motions [ 13]. Our system employs a parameter switch akin to the

Weight attribute methodology to govern input prompts, categoriz-
ing motion as "sustained" or "sudden" depending on whether the
input speed exceeds or falls below the average speed threshold.
The tested AI generation utilizes preassigned prompts of "geo-
metric" and "organic" corresponding to "sustained" and "sudden"
motions, as depicted in Figure 3. However, the generated content
exhibited body deformation potentially stemming from the input
video’s characteristics and the dynamic nature of the movement
sequence, necessitating further investigation. Conversely, the gener-
ation adheres to constant prompts of the "human body" and "dance-
hall," employing the extracted wheelchair as a guiding image.
3.4 Discussion
This study employs machine learning’s body segmentation tech-
niques to categorize wheelchair dance into the domains of embodied ,
incorporeal , and cybernetic , enabling exploration of the relationship
between wheelchair movements and artistic identity, highlighting
the potential for creative expression and reimagining the role of the
wheelchair as an extension of the dancer’s body or an independent
dancing entity in performance contexts.
By incorporating an established artistic visualization solution,
the system leverages AI-generated prompt inputs to enhance move-
ment control, enabling personalized visualizations aligned with
chosen LMA Effort qualities in wheelchair dance, thereby ampli-
fying the system’s adaptability and empowering artists to enrich
the creative landscape of wheelchair dance. Future studies should

consider categorizing prompts specifically in dance vocabulary and
the incorporation with wheelchair dance vocabulary.
Despite the system’s significant contribution to wheelchair dance,
it is important to address existing technical constraints, including a
latency range of two to five seconds attributed to cloud API stability,
internet connectivity, and local processing capacity, alongside the
necessity for a clean, high-contrast background for comprehensive
body segmentation, emphasizing the need for solutions to prioritize
end-user adaptability and real-time visualization quality within the
framework of the LMA Effort theory.
3.5 Conclusion
This paper presents ongoing research at the intersection of posthu-
manism and adaptive visualization in wheelchair dance, catego-
rizing the framework as embodied ,incorporeal , and cybernetic to
highlight the dynamic relationship between the dancer and the
wheelchair, fostering artistic expression and embracing technol-
ogy’s potential to transcend physical limitations and diverse artistic
identities.
Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven prompt generation,
controlled by movement features based on LMA Effort theory, offers
a flexible and adaptable means of artistic expression. Dancers can
harness this technology to craft personalized visual narratives,
amplifying their creative agency. However, it is crucial to address
technical limitations such as processing latency and background
requirements to ensure the practicality and real-time applicability
of these innovative solutions.This research paves the way for further exploration in the evolv-
ing field of wheelchair dance, highlighting the significance of user
adaptability and personalized artistic expression, with future re-
search focusing on enhancing prompt input, refining adaptive move-
ment data extraction, minimizing generation latency, and engaging
in user testing with wheelchair dancers, thus contributing to the
ongoing discourse on the intersection of technology, artistic iden-
tity, and assistive tools within the realm of posthumanism and
wheelchair dance.
