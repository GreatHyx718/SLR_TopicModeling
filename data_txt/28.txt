ABSTRACT
Climate change, loss of plant biodiversity, and ocean pollution
signal the drastic changes in our ecology that call us to attend to the
needs of more than human forms of life on Earth. Sustainable design
and HCI research are responding to this call by offering methods
and approaches to design more sustainable products and systems
and recently, more than human design is building momentum. This
agenda seeks to reform traditional design processes by decentering
the creative agency of the dominant socio-economical group of
humans and foregrounding those of diverse Others.
In this paper, I focus on plants as a nonhuman form of life.
Through synthesizing multiple research methods, such as field-
work in nature, autoethnographic writings, drawing, "outpainting"
with Generative AI (genAI), visual and thematic analysis, I propose
a more than human creative process. In pursuit of that purpose, I
use the notion of "transcorporeality," developed by feminist Stacy
Alaimo [ 2], as a lens to develop designers’ capacities to attend to
the material configuration of human and nonhuman bodies. Decen-
tering the designer’s creativity is an aspirational goal, which for
various reasons is quite difficult to achieve fully, but the approach
undertaken in this project, at a minimum, complicates the experi-
ence of human-centered design creativity. It does so by increasing
perceptiveness and insight within what Alaimo refers to as "the
literal contact zones" between human and nonhuman corporeality;
leveraging that heightened capacity to synthesize the practices of
traditional nature writing and autoethnographic writing to reveal
and engage the enmeshment of the self in/as nature; and finally
leveraging discursive text and my drawings as prompts for genAI’s
outpainting technique, to experience how it extends, disrupts and
reworks what I have done, revealing not only its own biases, but
also many of my own.

1 INTRODUCTION
The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research community has
been exploring ways to contribute to social and environmental
sustainability challenges through practical and theoretical inter-
ventions, such as sustainable interaction design and sustainable
HCI [ 14,26]. Given that it is a multi-dimensional challenge, not sur-
prisingly, HCI researchers have pursued diverse approaches. Some
have approached it at the macro level, connecting HCI to the politi-
cal roles of end consumers and industries in shaping sustainable
futures [ 27]. Ecofeminism-informed HCI scholars have considered
the links between gender inequality and climate change —both
subjected to paradigms of control [ 51,52,91,98]— and proposed
ways that HCI might intervene against these dominant practices.
Another body of work has questioned how human-centered
thinking, including human-centered design, has contributed to cli-
mate crisis, pursuing as an alternative a multispecies, posthuman
[33,42], sometimes called more than human design perspective
[57,77,95,96]. This collection of research has considered research
on human and animal cohabitation [ 88], turned to concepts such as
nomadism and nomadic practice as a guide to an alternative human-
ist design and HCI discipline which embraces multiplicity and di-
versity rather than universality in design [ 94], and used theoretical
concepts such as abjection to attend to the ecological relationships
between humans and nonhumans, such as those with birds [13].
More than human design challenges HCI and design researchers
to think beyond objectives such as control and trust, and to seek
ways to sustain our very human lives as a part of Others’ lives. It
seeks ways to design better, more sustainable, and just futures by
reforming traditional design and creative processes. Key to this
approach is decentering humans in an attempt to foreground the
needs, agency, and forms of creativity of nonhuman Others. This ap-
proach can be challenging for design researchers and practitioners,
whose training has traditionally prepared them to develop creative
ways to improve problematic situations and address human needs
[22,32,37,38]. Researchers of more than human design have thus
grappled with the question of how to decenter humans, including
design researchers themselves, considering the human-centered
nature of design.
HCI research can approach more than human design challenges
from a number of angles. In the present work, I focus on human-
plant relationships for several reasons. Much, though not all, of

HCI research in this space, focuses more on animals than on plants,
which reflects our predominantly zoocentric traditions in sciences
and philosophies [ 45]. Further, carrying the eco-feminist theme
forward, plants are often seen as a "lower" or less intelligent form of
life than animals and treated accordingly [ 62]. Additionally, plants
can be more difficult for humans to relate to —their nervous systems
and basic physiology are far more different from ours than most
animals’ [ 21]. As such, plants feature greater alterity than animals
do, which makes them easier to "other" and harder for us humans to
perceive and to deeply feel our connections to them [ 67], revealing
some of the limitations of an empathetic approach to vegetal life
[63]. HCI research on human-plant interaction can help to overcome
our biases and failures to perceive our interconnectedness with
plant life, and in doing so more fully answer the call for a more
than human design practice [58].
While perceiving and deeply feeling our connections to plants
is challenging, we also have resources, including theoretical re-
sources and existing practices. In this work, I draw from several
related theories, in particular, the work of Alaimo, whose concept of
transcorporeality supports my research objective to express human-
plant relationships in support of more than human design research.
More specifically, building on previous works in this space (e.g.,
[11,96]) I propose a speculative practice that involves writing and
drawings in nature and outpainting with Generative AI (genAI). In
addition to theory, the proposed practice is also informed by a range
of existing practices, including botanical drawing [ 83], landscape
ethnography [ 76] and nature writing [ 60] as some self-reflexive
ways of communicating more than human nature in their habitat.
Self-reflexive writings about nature, independent from the writer’s
identity, epistemological, and socioeconomic position, start from
an act of expressing nature and the life of non-humans, which then
talks back to the human writer to outwardly include the writer’s
position in nature as a whole. Similarly, botanical drawings are a
cultural product and embed the scientist’s and artist’s position, cul-
ture, and subjectivity in the choice of media, mark-making, details,
and style.
As I explain in more detail later, the speculative practice entails
going into natural environments that feature plants, engaging in
acts of drawing and writing, subsequently analyzing and synthe-
sizing those drawings and writings, and then using them as both
visual and verbal prompts for genAI to outpaint them. In this paper,
I used the word "outpainting" with two different but interrelated
meanings: (1) as a specific genAI technique (OpenAI’s DALL.E2),
that extends an image beyond the original frame by adding pixels to
it, (2) more metaphorically, as a way to talk about how the process
decentered my creativity as a design researcher, by augmenting my
creative work and subjectivity, helping to expose my own biases
and preconceptions.
Obviously, any use of genAI comes with concerns. genAI is
trained on human-created data, using large datasets; therefore, it
generates from human, and not more than human, datasets, and
so in itself, it cannot be considered more than human. Worse, the
data it is trained on reflects centuries of social injustice, including
racism, sexism, and colonial thoughts and practices [ 18,28,74].
Further, AI consumes considerable resources, including water and
energy to train the models, power the data centers and to cool
them down [ 10,34,70] and thereby contributes to the problems ofclimate change that most HCI sustainability research is seeking to
address.
This paper seeks to self-reflexively stay with these concerns [ 48]
and unpack them as they relate to the purpose of this paper: develop-
ing a speculative practice in support of expressing the human-plant
relationship through attending to the transcorporeality of human-
nonhumans and political and ethical possibilities of that connection
[2]. It leverages the insight that what AI generates can be surprising,
and that surprise can, through reflection, reveal our own biases and
also reveal alternative ways of seeing and thinking. In this paper,
outpainted images were generative because they literally expanded
my drawings. Those expansions were subject to genAI’s unpre-
dictable combination of competently parroting human art (e.g.,
using line drawings to represent common objects and stippling to
add texture and shading to them) and what are increasingly known
as AI hallucinations [ 61] (i.e., where AI produces nonsensical or
absurd results), the result of which were a number of surprises,
many of which featured violations of norms of representation (e.g.,
spatial perspectives, scale, light and shadows, figure/ground). These
surprises prompted my own reflection and occasionally confronted
me with my own tacit assumptions and unrealized biases, while
the resulting outpainted images supported my reimagining, and
working towards, alternate possible local worlds, as described in
[31].
In summary, the paper describes a creative and autoethnographic
inquiry of a design researcher with a background in arts, design and
sustainability. It shows how I experimented with classical creative
methods of immersion within nature (e.g., nature walks, nature
writing, sketching, observation, reflection), as well as new technolo-
gies like genAI, to attune to the nuances of plant life. This paper
contributes to the more than human design agenda and strives to
understand how the HCI community might begin to decenter the
human.
2 GROUNDS AND RELATED WORKS
This research integratively uses a number of key sources: HCI
research on sustainability, and in particular, more than human
approaches to designing in the context of climate crisis; practices of
depicting plants, including botanical drawings and nature writing;
and theoretical resources, in particular those of Anna Tsing [ 92]
and Stacy Alaimo [ 2], whose notion of transcorporeality shaped
both the development of my approach and the articulation of its
outcomes.
2.1 Sustainable and More Than Human Design
In sustainability-related human-computer interaction (HCI) and
design research, posthumanism [ 33] poses one of its central epis-
temic challenges: how can humans decenter humans in a practical
sense while trying to achieve the human goal of designing for more
than human worlds and building more sustainable futures [ 95].
Oogjes and Wakkary used the concept of repertoire to attend to
the different ways human designers can facilitate the participa-
tion of nonhumans in design research practices [ 77]. The authors
employed methods such as landscape ethnography and Tsing’s con-
cept of noticing to weave the stories of the design researcher into
the nonhuman actors’ stories. Care as a lens has been employed
96
"The Words We Do Not Yet Have." A Creative Inquiry Into Human-Plant Relationships Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
for speculative and feminist posthumanism [ 53] or in sustainable
agrilogistics [ 68] through ethnographic studies in the farms of the
American Midwest [12].
Another relevant stream of research in the HCI and design re-
search is the relationships between humans and nonhuman lives,
or "nature." In this area, researchers either seek to use technology
to mediate the human-nature relationship ([ 71,97]) or to consider
nature as a participant in the design process under the umbrella
of human-nature interaction or multispecies design [ 4]. Loh et al.’s
work is particularly relevant to this paper, where they surveyed a
series of human-plant interaction design projects and offered ways
that HCI can move from the view of plants as utilitarian objects to
plants as co-inhabitant, contributing to the more-than-human turn
in human-plant interaction design [ 58]. Attending to the complex-
ities and nuances of human nature relationships has also been re-
searched in numerous works. For instance, Rodgers et al. identified
key human relationships with nature by probing participants’ re-
lationships with their gardens, inspired by Phenology, which is the
study of cyclic biological events [ 82]. Vella et al. used camera traps
to observe the interactions of participants with their gardens (plants
and animals) and identified two different relations with nature: care
and control [ 93]. Spors et al. conducted a scoping literature re-
view of human-nature interaction publications in recent years and
identified four types of interactions with nature or, as they put it,
"encountered, approached and made sense of nature": (1) nature as
a research site (2) depiction and portrayal of nature, (3) modalities
of encountering nature, (4) understandings of nature [89].
Common to most of these works is an attempt to (re)connect
to nature and make sense of our relationship with nature with its
multitude of dimensions, whether through observation techniques,
personal experience, or artifacts that support moments of reflection.
2.2 Transcorporeality
Tsing highlights that "making worlds is not limited to humans," and
we are surrounded by many nonhuman world-making projects [ 92].
Each world-making project has the capacity to alter our planet by
making ecological living places and workable living environments.
Those worlds can also overlap, allowing space for more than one
species –e.g., when "beavers shape streams as they make dams,"
or "plants live on the land because fungi make soil by digesting
rocks," or "pines flourish in landscapes burnt by humans." Tsing
uses the concept of "assemblage," which not only shows us the
potential of histories in the making but also us as a kind of subject
in the making [ 92]. Tsing also compares it to polyphonic music,
in which individual and independent melodies intertwine to make
music; there is no leading element but a horizontal and organic
assemblage of sounds and voices. Similarly, Barad’s feminist and
quantum physics notion of Intra-action conceptualizes the mutual
agency of entangled entities, that is the actions emerge only from
within the relationships among inseparable entities ([ 8], p.79). Barad
writes: "A phenomenon is a specific intra-action of an “object” and
the “measuring agencies”; the object and the measuring agencies
emerge from, rather than precede, the intra-action that produces
them." ([8], p.79-80).
Alaimo made a closely related argument in her concept of transcor-
poreality. However, whereas Tsing’s assemblages focus on the het-
erogeneity of sites in accommodating multiple species and eventheir "worlds," Alaimo focuses specifically on the "literal contact
zones" between human and nonhuman corporeality. Alaimo’s work
critiques certain postmodernist feminist analysis of the body and
nature, which she argues divide woman from nature, such that, and
here Alaimo quotes Julia Kristeva: "nature, charged as an acces-
sory to essentialism, has served as feminism’s abject—that which,
by being expelled from the ’I,’ serves to define the ’I’." ([ 54] page
1-4, cited in [ 1]). Instead, Alaimo invites us to attend to relational
aspects, where human corporeality is transcorporeality, in which
the human and nonhuman bodies are always intermeshed. That
understanding leads us to underlay the extent to which the human
is ultimately inseparable from the “environment,” and that very
understanding makes it impossible to put nature as the background
[2]. Alaimo’s transcorporeality is an ethical and political stance,
which "dwells in dissolve, where the fundamental boundaries have
begun to come undone". Similar to Braidotti’s "sustainable becom-
ing" subject [ 16], transcorporealilty proposes an ethical subject
that is ordinary and rooted in everyday micro-practices of living
life on the Earth ([ 3], page 2-3). Alaimo argues further for a need
to integrate practices such as nature writing and popular science
writing –as one of the most crucial genres of environmentalism– to
science writing. Because these every day "micro-practices" produce
a "highly immediate and highly mediated" kind of knowledge that
supports a better grasp of biospheric connections ([3], page 3).
Common to Tsing’s "polyphonic assemblages" and Alaimo’s
transcorporeality is the idea of an interconnected mesh of bod-
ies, where none is backgrounded or foregrounded, and that these
bodies are inseparable from the environment. The concept of not
having or being a center is a key idea that ties together all the parts
of this research paper.
2.3 Depicting Plants
Two major relevant and interrelated areas of study after ecology
and botany have offered tools and practices for communicating
nonhumans: feminist studies of ecological and evolutionary phe-
nomena of human-nonhuman lives [ 50] and Critical Plant Studies
(CPS) [ 90]. Critical Plant Studies is an interdisciplinary field that
aims to re-imagine and reexamine our relationships with the plants
and vegetal world [ 55]. It draws on diverse disciplinary fields within
arts, humanities, and social sciences, such as ecocriticism, anthro-
pology, STS, and feminism [ 43]. Following their lead, this study
also turns to nature writing, in landscape ethnography [ 76] and
botanical drawing [83] to communicate about plants.
2.3.1 Nature Writing. Nature writing is a nonfictional genre of
writing about nature [ 60] and has a long history across continents
and cultures. We can find writing about nature in ancient Persia,
India, and China, in poetry or prose [ 102]. Despite the long history,
nature writing in prose "has achieved a unique fullness and continu-
ity within Anglo-American context" and was highly influenced by
naturalist writings in English literature [ 29]. It has three distinct di-
mensions: information about natural history, personal responses to
nature, and philosophical interpretation of nature ([ 60] p.20-22). Es-
says on natural history can be in the form of first-person narratives,
such as in John Hay’s Spirit of Survival (1974), which adds a per-
sonal reflection and meaning to the scientific facts and observations
[49], or from a third person perspective such as in Rachel Carson’s
The Sea Around Us (first published in 1950), where she presents a
97
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Ghajargar
collection of scientific facts of oceanography, but tellingly to repre-
sent ecological humans relationships with the ocean [ 20]. When
nature writing is on the human experience and the connection
between humans and nonhumans, scientific facts are featured less
than qualities of human experience, as in Stephanie Mills’ In Service
of the Wild (1995), where she talks about healing the biodiversity
and care for nature by attending to her needs [66]. Terry Tempest
Williams’ Refuge (1991) also wrote a biographical piece on her own
childhood memories as a way to write about human-nonhuman
connections ([ 100], p.21). Accordingly, writing about nature can
take an ethnographic form, where the subject of the ethnographer’s
study is the landscape and the relationships between humans and
nonhumans. Hence it can be one of "the ways in which our relations
with nonhumans produce what it means to be human" [76].
Similar to other cultural products, North American nature writ-
ing is tied to the complexities of the continent’s social, cultural, and
political becoming. For decades, the genre was practiced only by a
fraction of society, which consisted mainly of white, upper-class,
educated, and wealthy individuals who had the time and financial
resources to experience nature for pleasure and as a source of in-
spiration. However, that tradition has slowly and gradually started
to transform to include feminist, women, and Black writers who
reflected on their own unique experiences of nature, which often
represented traces of identity, origins, belonging, class, and social
injustice. One example is Black nature writing, which often links ex-
periences of nature from socially and economically disadvantaged
and marginalized Black American communities. As Erin Sharkey
puts it, "Just as the ways we [African Americans] experience nature
in this country are not isolated from our identities, nature writing
is not neutral" [ 85]. Similarly, starting from the twentieth century,
women nature writers started to connect their writings to feminist
values, such as in ecofeminist writings, in which nature was a key
to express gender discrimination and injustice [ 79] and that women
and nature are notions with historically complex interrelationships,
as the same forces and ideologies that want to control the natural
environment, want to control women.
2.3.2 Botanical Drawing. Building on previous works, Gemma
Anderson, in her book Drawing as a Way of Knowing in Art and Sci-
ence argues about drawing as a collaborative tool and method that
bridges the arts and sciences [ 5], and that is used to point and to ad-
dress questions ([ 5], p.4). Drawing can also "make visible relations
between things that otherwise remain invisible." ([ 5], p.18). Botani-
cal drawing is an observational technique; that is, in Goethe’s words,
it reflects what the person sees in the world, and it leads to reflection
and from reflection to combination and theorizing ([ 44] cited in [ 5],
p.18). In the late eighteenth century, Goethe’s Metamorphosis of the
Plants focused on the dynamic and transformative forms of plants
rather than their static forms and shapes [ 44]. A practice that he
calls "delicate empiricism" is a morphological method for studying
plants through prolonged, reflective, and empathetic observation,
"grounded in direct experience" ([ 5], p.119). This practice improves
observers’ ability to see outwardly and to become more sensitive
and attentive observers of plant development. Anderson’s note on
this method emphasizes that Goethe’s aspiration was to develop
human subjective experiences, rather than assuming we can avoidit in studying nature so that an observer "becomes an instrument
of their own mediation of the world" ([5], p.119).
Botanical drawing was pivotal not only in scientific discover-
ies and communications but also in women’s empowerment and
scholarship. As Anna Sagal points out [ 83], the domestic spaces of
home and the garden provided abundant opportunities for women’s
"emotional fulfillment and meaningful intellectual labor" in the
eighteenth century. Further, she conceptualizes the notion of "en-
tanglement" as a way for women to rework and subvert the re-
strictive dynamics of the woman and nature relationship by using
woodlands and gardens.
Common to both nature writing and botanical drawing practices
are their power to support an ability to see outwardly and to look
beyond oneself to cultivate a sense of closeness and intimacy with
more than humans.
3 METHODOLOGY
The primary goal of this project is to improve one’s capacities to
attend, as a designer researcher, to one’s connection to the bio-
sphere, specifically to plant life. Alaimo’s concept of transcorpore-
ality shaped my approach. I started to explore creative everyday
"micro-practices" for depicting plant species [ 1]. I decided to start
with drawing and writing about plants and their ecological environ-
ment reflexively and outwardly [ 5,44,60,64]. Other similar practice
such as Natasha Myers’s Kriya is a meditation and breathing tech-
nique that is commonly practiced in Yoga, which further aims to
broaden our subjectivity and to include those of plants so as to be
able to express the vegetal life [ 69] outwardly. The methodological
process that I present here is inspired by several other theories
and practices, such as Indigenous embodied practices of knowing
nature [ 11], tactics to decolonize research methodologies [ 87] as
well as centuries of practices in visual and literary arts and scien-
tific facts on the positive effects of nature on creativity [ 78,103].
However, I arranged the methodological process in a particular or-
der and sought to translate theories into embodied and intentional
"micro-practices" that are unique to designerly practices and ways
of knowing, in general, [ 23] and to more than human design [ 96]
in particular.
During this year-long project, I visited 11 natural reserves and
parks in Sweden and the USA and spent about 48 hours in nature
walking and drawing (an average of 4 hours (–/+2 hour) in each
natural setting). The methodological process started with the choice
of places in the vicinity of my place (Southern Sweden and Southern
California). I deliberately chose to visit places that were nearby and
within 20 miles/31km in an attempt to reduce the environmental
impacts of travel. I gathered information about the site’s plant
biodiversity, native species, flora and fauna, and the geographical
characteristics of the place, such as if there was a river, damps,
lakes, and hills.
Another goal is to expand my creativity toolkit by probing
genAI’s outpainting capabilities and limitations, while fully cog-
nizant that genAI reflects and perpetuates biases imbued in human
society. Outpainting (OpenAI’s DALL.E2) is a genAI technique;
it uses AI to generate new pixels that extend an image’s existing
boundaries, meaning that we can add new details to an image, ex-
tend the background, or create a panoramic view. The technique is
98
"The Words We Do Not Yet Have." A Creative Inquiry Into Human-Plant Relationships Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
prompted both by a text prompt (i.e., my nature writings) and an
image (i.e., my drawings). It then adds visual frames in continuity
around the prompt image. It learns from both the visual elements
of the image and the text prompt. I used drawings of specific indi-
vidual plants and nature writings of the same place. I was drawn
to outpainting for two reasons: its primary inputs and outputs are
image-based rather than text-based, and it both depends on and
also literally extends my work in a way that is both high fidelity
and usually surprising. That combination of high fidelity and sur-
prise often contributes to an experience of feeling pushed aside
as the creator. Thus, even as outpainting can literally move the
art I drew out of the center (e.g., by outpainting content on the
right, my image moves to the left of the total composition), I also
experience decentering as a creative when genAI pushes me aside
as the creator of the work.
All of the above resolved into a multi-stage fieldwork process,
which supported attending to the plants, their sensory qualities,
the ecological settings, and the plant’s relationships with humans
and surroundings; and subsequently genAI reworking my verbal
and visual depictions of plants. The process unfolded in four steps
as follows: (1) learning: embodied ecological walks, (2) probing:
intra-active observations, (3) expressing: words and drawings, (4)
outpainting: plants and I. In this paper, I focus primarily on the last
two steps: expressing and outpaining.
3.1 Positionality Statement
Neither Sweden nor the USA is my birthplace, and I live in the USA
on the unceded lands of Juaneno. In the spirit of self-reflexivity, I po-
sition myself as an educated Iranian, middle-aged woman, first gen,
and immigrant. This work was approached through a very personal
and self-reflexive way, which may or may not resonate with other
fellow humans whose diverse cultures, ideologies, political stands,
genders, and childhood experiences, shaped their subject and led
them to experience the world the way they do. My cultural and
educational background in arts, design, and sustainability provided
me with the means to think ecologically and to layer sustainability
commitments with those of design and intersectionality.
3.2 Expressing: Words and Drawings
After nature walks, observing, and attending to ecological connec-
tions between plants and other species, I chose a spot and sat down
on the ground where I could have the space and possibility to en-
gage and to see the plants and their ecology more closely. Then, I
drew plants and wrote about them and their surroundings [ 36]. The
practice of sitting on the ground was inspired by Welling’s Spirit
Walk . It is a practical and accessible method for nature writing, and
the major steps are naming, detailing, and interacting [99].
Sitting on the ground after long and slow nature walks and
observations was yet another practical means to immerse my sub-
ject fully in a more-than-human nature. Further, sitting and lying
on the ground aimed to help change the human perspective (e.g.,
seeing from human eye-level while walking) to that of humans,
such as mosses, SkyLupines, and Bilbery, by getting the head and
eyes close to the ground. This bodily practice allowed to see the
plants and their particularities from a perspective that was perhaps
closer to theirs than ours. I predominantly used inks with differentmark-making techniques, such as stippling and hatching (Figure:
2).
I creatively engaged with drawings, especially with different
line weights and mark making, as my pen moved through the
surface of the paper and aligned with what my eyes were seeing
and what my body was feeling. Those were essential ingredients
for this experiment of crafting a creative process of drawings and
writings that captured my experience of interacting with plants
but from a different perspective. I further kept a journal about
the plants but also started to engage in a more intentional way of
writing about plants: nature writing. As introduced above, nature
writing is a non-fiction literary work composed by humans about
nonhuman natures, including plants and animals. I let the situation,
the environment and what I felt at the moment guide me in deciding
to start with writing or drawing and how and when to switch
between these two creative processes.
3.3 Outpainting: Plants and I
In this last step, I used outpainting (a genAI technique) as a way
to extend, change, and go beyond what I observed and expressed
in nature, including other plants, humans, sea, river, etc. I first
prepared my drawings and writings for genAI by reworking them,
while seeking to keep the lines and styles of expressions as close
as possible to the original drawings, to keep the expressions of the
plants true to the feelings of the moment. This step was to focus on
my own art (not on AI art) and to compose and elaborate further on
the expression and memories of the place and the plants. Although
AI is sometimes perceived as a collaborator (e.g., [ 39,56,73,81]),
I intentionally wanted to experiment with genAI as a tool for cre-
ativity [ 35,86]. When I felt satisfied with my drawings, I scanned
each of them to have digital copies. I used image editing software
(e.g., Adobe Photoshop) to reduce the size to about 1MB and re-
moved the background, and saved it in PNG (Portable Network
Graphic) format. The transparent background helps the genAI dif-
fusion model which uses a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained
(CLIP) building block, to fill the negative spaces in the image during
image generation –i.e., to fill the white spaces between leaves and
petals instead of regarding them as input and reproducing the same
negative spaces.
Lastly, I imported each drawing to the 0utpainting application
and wrote one to two phrases as prompts to generate about 50-60
frames around the drawings. In the prompts, I mostly used nature
journal entries and nature writings of places I visited. In particular, I
chose those writings that included other forms of life, bodies and ac-
tivities, such as "children", "sea" and "swimming", and plant’s name
and characteristics. The assumption was that the genAI would pick
up on the style of drawing and use the textual prompt and the
drawing as a visual prompt to illustrate the ecology of the place.
During the process, I sometimes removed and edited some parts
of AI-generated images, for example, if they were repetitive or if
they were not adding anything meaningful to the overall composi-
tion. Figure 3, shows two examples of outpainted images. Each is
organized in three rows: the top row shows my photographs and
drawings, the second row shows the AI-generated image, and the
bottom row presents the prompt I wrote and used for outpainting.
The numbers on each image are used to clarify the steps in the
creation process.

3.4 Visual and Thematic Analysis
I collected data that included auto-ethnographic notes, nature writ-
ings, drawings, photographs, and AI outpaintings. Due to the dif-
ferent kinds of data, I used and combined two different methods:
visual analysis [ 84] and thematic analysis [ 17]. I conducted the
visual analysis for each image based on their formal elements, such
as color, scale, shapes, perspective, and principles of design, such
as unity in variety, rhythm and balance [ 84]. In the visual analysis,
I sought to identify elements that visualize concepts or theories
informing this research, such as Alaimo’s transcorporality [ 2], and
Tsing’s polyphonic assemblages [ 92] (Fig. 4). The visual analysis
process unfolded as follows: I organized the drawings and pictures
and labeled them according to the name of the place and the kind
of natural habitat (e.g., mountain, garden, forest, wetland, etc.). I
attended to each outpainted image and formulated a claim, which
is the intention of the artist or research question of the design
researcher [ 84]. Then, I coded and wrote about the piece, consid-
ering how formal elements and the principles of design in each
outpainted image impacted the meaning and the overall organiza-
tion of the work. For the purpose of analysis, I chose four of them asrepresentative of different seasons, natural habitats, and locations
(Fig. 4).
Figure 4: Visual analysis of the outpainted images.
Using Braun and Clarke’s formulation of Thematic Analysis
(TA), I sought patterns in the data across different data sources
(e.g. autoethnographic notes, written visual analysis, and nature
writings). I followed six phases of reflexive thematic analysis: fa-
miliarising, coding, generating initial themes, developing themes,
naming themes and writing ([ 17], p.35). TA allowed to see shared
meanings, patterns and experiences and making sense of those
commonalities by coding the data (Fig. 5).
4 RESULTS
The key challenge of the data analysis in this project was analyzing
the data that were collected through different forms of media: visual,
verbal, and embodied. However, despite the fact that verbal lan-
guage may fall short in communicating the richness and multitude
of dimensions of experiences and emotions, the verbal language in
the writings –albeit different kinds of writings (autoethnographic
notes, nature writings, and written visual analysis)– proved to be a
suitable meeting point of different forms of data.
The written data were coded and thematically analysed to find
commonalities across various media and sections. The result of this
100
"The Words We Do Not Yet Have." A Creative Inquiry Into Human-Plant Relationships Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
process led to the identification of several initial themes (e.g., meta-
morphosis, social ecology, more than human dimensions, moving
bodies, noticing, attending, transforming, reflective conversation
with plants through drawing, etc.). The initial themes were syn-
thesized and clustered twice, first into six themes, then into three
main themes based on the similarities and shared patterns. The
main themes were labeled as follows: (1) heeding, (2) walking and
drawing (with) others, and (3) transforming. The other three themes
were social ecology, which took part in the theme of heeding; the
life of others, which clustered under the theme of walking and draw-
ing (with) others; and the more than human dimensions, which
were included in the thematic cluster of transforming.
Some of the themes had stronger connections with specific places
and/or seasons than others. For instance, the theme of transforming
was more present in the spring season in Southern California, while
social ecology and heeding were more ubiquitous in the writings
and drawings of winter in Southern Sweden.
Figure 5: Coding and thematic data analysis.
4.1 Heeding
The theme of heeding was presented through two ways of see-
ing: one was active looking, manifested mostly while intentionally
attending to the plants’ colors, shapes, particularities, and rela-
tionships for drawings; the other one felt forced or pushed by the
environment onto me, at least initially, and then shifted to an in-
tentional way of seeing, such as when I noticed strange things or
unexpected shapes in the outpainted images such as the absence of
perspective or cast shadows. In both ways, I heeded the plants by
expressing through and analyzing drawings. The theme of heed-
ing included several ways to attend to more than human nature,
which spans from the individual physical attributes to the ecologi-
cal identities and relationships. In my nature journal, I found notes
about plants that were in green colors that were particular and were
different than a normal green color that one attributes to leaves
(September 22): there are these trees here that have leaves that are
not as green as one might assume. Some are silver-green, some oth-
ers are blue-ish. Noticing the tints and hues is not an unexpected
skill for someone who has training in visual arts and design. But
nonetheless, I noticed them differently and wrote about them in
a relational and ecological way rather than separated from their
environment. For instance, rather than describing a plant color
as if it was, say, Pantone Chateau Green, instead I noticed tints
of the plants in relation to their movements in different places I
visited (August 2022; April 2023): it has grown from an old trunk
of a tree, in three directions. The new branches are thin and golden.They move around delicately with the breeze. In Southern California,
however, it was impossible not to notice the super bloom season,
with all those tall and delicate bright yellow flowers, sweeping around
with the mountain breeze , similarly impossible to ignore, was the
bright orange color of California poppies in the Blue Sky ecological
reserve, March 2023.
I noticed the fact that even in the strictly vegetal world, there
are some plants that can be easily pushed into the background or
be foregrounded –e.g., the bright orange color of poppies makes
it very easy to be noticed, in comparison to the soft green color of
baby Fremont Cottonwoods (Figure 6). But while walking among
the mountains, even those plants that were impossible to over-
look opened up for me some deeper encounters with native (and
not native) plants (Figure 6). As Tsing highlighted, world-making
processes are activities that every form of life, including humans,
animals, plants, and fungi, are engaged with, and as a result of
those activities, we alter the environment, the world-making, and
ultimately the worlds of the others [ 92]. I reflected on the value of
those non-native plants that have yet to be discovered. What kind
of worlds were they making? which worlds were they altering?
why were they here? are they lost? were they forced to leave their
homes? I was noticing plants, starting from their visual appearances
or the botanical characteristics to noticing their identity, place, and
world-making processes.

September 22, I wrote: I can hear them [the birds], but I can also feel
their presence by the sudden yet subtle movements of the trees’ leaves
[...] the trees have this interesting and strange shapes [...] they have
cold-brown-green-ish trunks and medium size leaves. I noticed that I
was focusing much more on the shapes and colors than how leaves
sound in the wind or how a tree trunk sounds if I listened to it. But
Welling’s method of sitting on the ground and writing was helpful
in that it supported my full body sensory experience of the plants,
and as she puts it, our ears have three times more connections
to our brain than our eyes have [ 99]. As Wohlleben puts it, our
body often requires a full immersion in nature to be able to fully
notice and feel it, and listening, in particular, "hones our senses until
even stationary patterns register" [ 101]. That deep listening pause
disrupted the usual process of drawing. For instance, in August
2022, while I was listening to the sea waves meeting the shore, I
closed my eyes for a moment and listened to the wind blowing
among the wildflowers; when I reopened my eyes, I noticed the
movements of the shadows on the ground, which were overlooked
before. So, I drew the shadows by tracing the shadow lines on my
sketchbook (Figure 7). The practice of drawing the shadows of the
plants, instead of the plants themselves, helped to discover a new
101
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Ghajargar
emergent way to express plants and what they put into the world,
rather than a conventional scientific and/or artistic representation.
The theme of heeding was present in the visual materials through
formal elements but in an unexpected and organic way. I noticed
that some of the visual elements in the outpainted images did not
fit or were not coherent with the overall composition and meaning
of the work: elements that I would not have included in those
places and formats or would have drawn differently. I noticed them
because they were unexpected, troubling, or inharmonious to my
eyes as a design researcher.
For instance, I noticed there was little or no spatially represented
perspective in the images. Perspectives are a kind of optical illusion,
and we use them because we desire to represent an image as close to
what we as humans see in the real world. Thus, it is not surprising
that AI-generated images may lack those conceptions, as they do
not actually see and perceive the world the way we humans do.
Another unexpected formal element created by genAI was the
scale of representations. For instance, I noticed gigantic flowers
and leaves in comparison to tiny little human figures, creating
interesting but also disorienting juxtapositions (Figure 3). I further
noticed reflections of the figures on the surface of the water, an
absence of cast shadows, and the direction of light in the outpainted
images.
I observed formal elements, through vertical and horizontal
shapes and lines, that connected human and nonhuman figures.
I attended to how they intersected: humans were almost always
presented in vertical forms, while trees, flowers, and leaves were
presented both horizontally and vertically in several places. Also
noticeable were formal elements that isolated figures and habitats,
which otherwise were connected, such as the black isolated flower,
which was confined by the horizontal and vertical lines, or the sea
by the inland (Figure 3).

Sweden, August 2022.
4.2 Drawing (with) Others
The act of drawing plants not only clearly helped me to attend to
the ecological relationship between plants and others in a place
(e.g., I noticed a kind of social activity or the essence of what brings
different plant species together towards building a community) and
to the specifics of the plants (e.g., their individual and collectively
shared features), but also supported a self-reflexive process on my
own place within it. In addition, it provided me with a sense of
emerging connections to these two different countries, neither of
which was my home country. In relation to that, my notes were
reflections of an experience of a different and emerging life or a
new world in transition: I sat on the ground near the mosses for afew minutes and looked closely at the plants around me. It’s autumn,
so plants’ colors, shapes, and sounds are different; they even smell
differently, as if they were entering into a new and different world.
This note reflects my growing experiential awareness of what I had
read in Alaimo about the literal contact zone connecting diverse
bodies.
During one of my field work in Southern California (Dixon lake),
I observed a kind of transformation that was bigger than spring , and
it felt like something Other, something more than human. Some
plants made me reflect on my body scales in relation to each other
and their immense otherness. One example was the Yucca flower.
The one I encountered was in full bloom, sitting on a hill and was
as tall as I was (Figure 6). What is striking about it is that it is a
small shrub with a single, giant stem that grows about ten times
the size of the shrub, with a dramatic flower on top; that stem and
flower seems entirely out of proportion with the shrub and that
sense of "disproportion" creates the sense of Otherness.
Transitioning my analysis from my fieldwork to the results of
outpainting, the theme of Otherness also emerged. One of the out-
painted images strongly featured chiaroscuro elements, and while
analyzing the image ´s negative/positive spaces and their relation-
ships with each other, I discovered new subjects. For instance, in the
negative space outpainted between two trees, in one of the images,
a woman-like figure was standing tall and facing the observer (see
appendix, p.4), confounding Western artistic conventions, includ-
ing the figure/ground relationship and the visual scale. Likewise, a
horizontal line of the water in the San Elijo outpainted image, led to
a dark spot of a big bush, which looked again like a woman figure
standing along a vertical line (Figure 3). It felt similar to Angelucci’s
Arboretum [ 6], which foregrounds the photographs of trees on top
of the human figures in her photography, yet different in that in
outpainted imagery, the women figures were the products of two
or more other figures coming together in a composition (Figure 3).
Another visual feature, as described in the previous section, was
the omnipresence of "unexpected" and "unnatural" scales, such as a
very big owl or an enormous flower. The tree-like shape reflection
of a woman on the surface felt also both surprising and unsettling;
similarly, the trees, with big open mouths that seemed to be yelling
at the observer, were terrifying (Figure 3). The exercise of expe-
riencing abruptness and staying with it, without trying to fix or
reacting to it [ 48] led to a kind of deeper transformation that I write
about in the next section: Transforming.
4.3 Transforming
The theme of transformation was omnipresent in my writings
across places and plants that were going under a kind of bodily
transformation. These were expressed through my fieldwork writ-
ings. The theme of transformation was presented as either indi-
vidual transformation (e.g., of a leaf or a flower) or a more social
and collective transformation (e.g., of a forest). For instance, an
individual transformation was noted on September 4th, 2022, while
drawing a plant under the shadow of a tree (the place was about
ten minutes cycling from my home): the edges are sharper when the
leaf is older [...] they differentiate in forms and the negative spaces
[between the leaves and branches] as they grow. Another example
of individual transformation was a description of the branches of
102
"The Words We Do Not Yet Have." A Creative Inquiry Into Human-Plant Relationships Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
a beech tree, its organic and dynamic shapes as if they were in
movement and growing: [...] but the most interesting part of these
trees are the branches and how they seem to transform and grow.
During another visit, I drew the transformation of a mature tree
trunk by drawing young and delicate new leaves growing from
the edges of the top of the trunk and attracting other plant species
to themselves. Above the drawing, I wrote: two plants lives [are]
blended to each other, are they living happily?
Writing related to the theme of transformations in Southern
California was mostly about collective transformations, including
ourselves, places, and bodies. In March 2023, I visited Blue Sky
ecological reserve, which is a natural reserve with a lake situated at
1,312 ft above the sea level (about 400 m). I wrote: this is a very exotic
place! it feels like it’s going through a sort of major transformation,
something like a spring maybe, but bigger and more transformative.
It was then added I think that is [partly] because California has been
having some good rainy days [atmospheric rivers], basically since I
moved here.
The theme of transformation also came up in the visual analysis
of the Outpainted images. I observed several bodily transformations
in formal elements of the images through horizontal, vertical, and
diagonal lines across different AI-generated imagery. For instance,
in San Elijo image, the vertical lines that morphed from plant to
human, or from building to plant and to human-like figure were
omnipresent (figure 3). Similarly, in the same picture, the curvy line
of the river on the bottom right corner of the picture is noticeable,
leading to a tree trunk shape element, which morphs into a woman-
like figure. In the outpainted images, vertical lines of women-like
figures were omnipresent, that seemed to be growing from the soil,
or from a body of water, or from a rocky cliff, just like plants. These
vertical transformation lines were also found in the Sky Lupine
flower, which was outpainted into two women-like figures on the
top, facing each other (figure 3).
The theme of transformation was visualized not only through
lines but also through principles of rhythm and repetitions [ 84]. For
instance, a pattern of fish-like figures on the horizon, transformed
into a pattern of birds in the sky on top (figure 3), reminding me
of works of the artist M. C. Escher [ 30], who used repetitions (and
transformation) as a principle in his works –and this means genAI
clearly was trained on his works. Further, in one of the outpainted
images, an individual and more detailed transformation, perhaps
from a micro to a macro formal level, from flower petals to a woman-
like figure, was also palpable, reminding me of the African American
mixed media artist Wangechi Mutu [ 75] –which again may mean
that genAI was trained on her works. Further, I observed leaves
morphing into flower petals, echoing Goethe’s remarks that the
flowers are the results of a certain metamorphosis process of leaves
[44].
5 DISCUSSION
In this research, I focused on plants as a subject and a space to
creatively express the matters of sustainability, identity, belongings,
and otherness. In this section, using Alaimo’s transcorporeality to
help organize thought, I reflect on some of the ways depicting plant
species and ecology in this project created political and ethical
possibilities that emerge from the literal contact zone betweenhumans and nonhumans corporeality [ 2]; and the implications for
sustainable and more than human design.
To be clear, I emphasize that I do not claim to have resolved the
paradox of decentering a human-centered practice (i.e., design, cre-
ativity), but have sought to navigate that paradox in a self-reflexive
and transcorporeal way, arriving at a perspective on (and in) the
paradox. Hence, I will lay out and argue about multiple ways the
journey –writing, drawing, and outpainting, at times intentionally
and other times surprisingly– created political and ethical possibil-
ities and decentered my subjective perspective.
For this discussion, I focus on the ways that my creative engage-
ments with plants —as a visual artist/designer, a (nature) writer, and
an outpainter —reflexively changed me. Drawing plants in nature,
informed by writers such as Tsing [ 92] and Alaimo [ 2], helped me
to attend to the corporeal "literal contact zones" where my bod-
ies came together, and as I did, that zone grew in resonance and
detail, until it reflexively changed me. Likewise, heading into this
project inspired by the tradition of nature writing, I noticed over
time that my writing was becoming increasingly autoethnographic,
as changes in myself, brought on by my deepened engagement with
plants, evidenced transcorporeality. Finally, the outpainting part of
the project surprised and challenged me, as I hoped and expected
it would, but it did so in at least one way that I had not expected,
when its transgressions against conventions of depiction surfaced
and made me confront some of my own biases.
5.1 Transcorporeal Drawing(s)
Throughout this project, I produced writings and drawings that
were obviously all human-made cultural products. I walked, smelled,
and noticed like a human. Surely, I have felt all along not only a
sense of "biospheric connection" to the more-than-human nature
but also to myself. As I saw and wrote about transformations in
nature, I experienced it in myself (human); I heeded things in and
among plants, colors, perspectives, and ecologies, and drew with
others (genAI) as if I joined my Other selves, woman, immigrant,
human.
The creative engagement through observations, writing and
mark-making with the plants pushed me to go beyond merely rep-
resenting the plants and “pressing outward” in Marder’s words
(cited in [ 43]). My hands, touching the paper and holding the pen,
moved through the surface of the paper and aligned with what eyes
were seeing and what body was feeling, drew plants’ bodies and
captured bodies around them simultaneously. I am trying to repre-
sent in writing something of the experience of transcorporeality,
that is, what happens when the literal contact zone becomes the
focus; when that zone seems to expand, develop, and grow once it
receives that attention; and how I became otherwise as an outcome
of that growth. Drawing plants was an embodied practice: I was
not only noticing plants, but dancing light and shadows, the feel of
the paper, the movement of my hands and eyes and shifting body
on the hard ground. The bodies here also include those that we
do not normally understand to be biological: cultural, social and
experiential bodies. My senses crisscrossed and subverted tradi-
tional binaries between nature and culture, human and non-human.
As one example: while my left hand was feeling the texture of the
paper, my eyes used my embodied understanding of texture to note
103
Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland Ghajargar
details about the texture of plant stems and leaves I was looking
at, while my right hand used conventional techniques of drawing,
such as stippling (Fig. 2), to represent that texture that my eyes
were seeing and my other hand was feeling, on the very same piece
of paper I was drawing on.
In a different situation, I became attuned to plant shadows (Fig.
7). In the tradition of botanical drawing, noting color, volume, and
texture so that one can represent that graphically is central to the
practice. Initially, I defaulted to some of those practices. But at
times, it was as if the plants spoke back to me and demanded that
I attend to them in a different way. One such example happened
when, on a breezy day I was trying to draw a plant, but its bouncing
and bobbing in the breeze made it hard to draw. Suddenly, I saw
the plants’ shadows. The shadows were like figures that plants
put into the world in a transcorporeal relationship with the soil,
the tree trunk, and the sun. The shadows are visually flat and
represent the contour of a plant as a subject. They are not the
plant but an entity that emerges –to appropriate Barad’s notion–
from the soil, the plant, and the sun "intra-action" [ 7,8]. Shadows
do not represent plants the way pictures do. Still, that absence of
visual details and flatness made them uniquely guide my attention
to other and perhaps more subtle qualities of plants: movements,
when plants sway, their shadows sway accordingly: intimate and
trans corporeal [3, 43].
Clearly, drawing in nature was a multi-sensory activity which,
likerepertoire in Oogjes and Wakkary’s words, opened up ways
for me to facilitate the participation of nonhumans in the creative
processes [ 77] and to weave my stories to the plants’ stories. What I
experienced was more intimate even than weaving stories together,
however: as I became increasingly sensitized to the "literal contact
zones," my drawing itself changed –what I wanted to draw, how I
drew it, and how I felt as I was doing so. For me, transcorporeality
was transitioning from a heady theory to mundane sensations in
my fingertips [1].
5.2 Transcorporeal Writing(s)
I began this project inspired by nature writers, such as Rachel
Carson [ 19], Erin Sharkey [ 85], and Stephanie Mills [ 66], whose
writings linked their observations of nature with personal experi-
ences and societal issues, including public policy and economic and
environmental justice. But as this project changed my perspective,
those changes in me became a sort of evidence of the impacts of
my putative object of inquiry: plants in nature. This insight, that
changes in the observer as a result of engaging the observed, has a
long history in ethnography and is one of the deep justifications of
autoethnography [ 80], and analogous insights has been expressed
in HCI and design literature as well, e.g., [ 25,72]. Autoethnography
is a first-person [ 9,59] qualitative research approach, which allows
ethnographers to express their own first-person perspective regard-
ing a situation, by situating the “ethnographer as the protagonist
of the ethnographic narration” [80].
My nature writing shifted away from naturalistic science writ-
ing towards something like autoethnography, as it started to turn
toward more self-reflexive expressions. My words reflected changes
in my place of living, relationships, and surviving a global pandemic
and also the "I" that was being bodily morphed to instead of transi-
tioning to the new place. For example, writing about the details of ayucca flower in the Southern Californian mountains and how I felt
about it, as I discovered it, was not only about noticing a new exotic
plant species but also discovering my other selves as branches of
this more than human living society [ 13]. That expression was a
deep reflexive practice that led me (similar to Biggs et al. [ 13]) to
be simultaneously frightened and awed of the possibilities of the
growth and expansion of this world in building.
Seemingly, nature writing is a practice of ecological perception
of more than human nature and to "outwardly" include the human
writers themselves [ 60]. Thus, my writings, albeit mostly about
the trees, seasons, and flowers, their visual details, and environ-
ment, were weaved with the layers of my own stories of becom-
ing, a self-reflexive account of exploring and finding my place, my
footing, [ 77] or according to Ecofeminist scholar, Plumwood, the
"self-in-relation" ([ 79], cited in [ 98]). That process of getting to
know, closely looking at, and writing about plants did not exclude
me from the equation or did not put me in the background, but
was creating political and ethical possibilities of becoming a more
than human designer, self-reflectively. That self-embrace echoes
Plumwood’s critiques of social ecologists, who, like Bookchin [ 15],
question human domination by treating the human as a disease;
instead, Plumwood affirms that "the critique of human domination
must be part of the familiar and healthy practice of self-critical
reflection, not an acultural and ahistorical expression of self-hatred
and collective human-species guilt" ([ 79], p. 12). The visual and
thematic analysis of my own autoethnographic notes and writ-
ings was yet another practice aspirationally pressing towards the
decentering of the subject who was sitting in an office analysing
the data, and foregrounding my other self, the one who was in
the nature, wrote about and drew plants. This self-self-reflexive
data analysis method opened up ways of attending to a transcorpo-
real experiences, thoughts and ideas, by rejecting and separating
it from myself in an attempt to be able to attend and to notice the
other[1, 13].
5.3 Transcorporeal Outpainting(s)
Once my drawings were scanned and used as prompts for outpaint-
ing, I was confronted with a whole new kind of estrangement. There,
I saw entangled bodies, distorted scales, "wrong" perspectives, lack
of scale and cast shadows, blurry boundaries between habitats and
the species, between living and non-living subjects, "unexpected"
images, "unnatural" or abnormal greens, an unintentionality and
above all a profound lack of unity in the outpainted images. The
many ways that outpainting subverted my expectations, all while
also carrying forward with high fidelity key characteristics of my
work (e.g., black ink line drawings), was disorienting. But again,
with the aspirational goal of decentering my own creative agency,
I was not just "staying with the trouble" [ 48]; I was asking for it,
even if I wasn’t quite sure how it would manifest.
Though at the conceptual level it was not surprising that genAI
violated conventions of representation, the specific extent to which
genAI used, subverted, and seemingly randomly transformed or
flagrantly disregarded those conventions was surprising at the
more granular level of what it did with (and to) my initial drawings.
It joined objects of different scales; it morphed from one type of
object into another (e.g., from fish to birds); it produced shadows
that were distorted and took on a life of their own. My point is not
104
"The Words We Do Not Yet Have." A Creative Inquiry Into Human-Plant Relationships Mindtrek ’24, October 08–11, 2024, Tampere, Finland
to state the obvious, which is that genAI doesn’t "understand" art
and can not really produce it; rather, my point is that the specific
ways it expanded my work created new experiences of wonder and
sublimity. I have written earlier about my surprising first encounter
with the yucca in mountains, whose flower seemed to be entirely out
of proportion with the plant. When yucca plants were outpainted,
they became yelling giant trees (Fig. 3). In other words, just as
nature seemed to produce objects that did not respect norms of
scale and organic coherence, creating vegetal "monsters," so too
did genAI. That double-subversion of my expectation that organic
bodies should respect certain norms of scale suddenly inverted: I
realized that the problem was my own expectations, and at that
moment, I felt wonder all over again, though I was sitting at a
computer. And that experience, in turn, changed what I looked for,
both in nature and in outpainted art.
The use of outpainting opened up to a few benefits. First, it
worked as a tool for multispecies visual storytelling, to support
one’s ability to see and to question what surprising and "unex-
pected" and "abnormal" stories one could be part of [ 47]. The
genAI’s outpainting technique, although it works on the principle
of prediction, still yielded unexpected results. It clearly and literally
not only expanded my drawings but disrupted them, and through
that genAI transformed my drawings to include other characters,
humans and nonhumans. That transformation, which happened in
a rather unplanned and surprising manner, helped me to see a pluri-
verse, a world in the making, and to notice extraordinary subjects,
figures, and stories [ 31]. If my intention of putting the drawing at
the center and then outpaint it with genAI was to augment and
amplify my literally centered drawing, I was unsuccessful. In con-
trast, outpainting disrupted that narrative (due to genAI’s technical
imperfections) to show that not only was it not possible for the
drawing to be centered, but also to question the existence of any
center at all in the resulting images. For a research project focused
on the seemingly impossible task of decentering humans, I was
suddenly faced with an artifact where it was impossible to have a
center at all. In these ways, the outpainted imagery communicated
multiplicity of the stories [ 46] that were weaving polyphonically
[92] to each other to visualize a transcorporeality without back-
grounding or foregrounding any stories or components. The lonely
flower was highlighted as much as the female-like figure morphing
up from a tree, or the seaweeds. The multi-species world-making
process [ 92] was presented in the absence of "right perspective" or
scale.
Second, the outpainted images were evocative. They worked
as tools for reflection [ 38,40,41]. The images triggered thoughts
on how I could be in an embodied and affective relationship with
plants, that "is in many cases represented as a kind of ‘dance,’ which
is to say a series of movements and encounters in which the interde-
pendency of bodies acquires shape and form” ([ 65], p.16) of a world
in building. As Michael Marder puts it, the conditions for encoun-
tering plants, instead of confronting them as objects of knowledge,
are their interactivity and distinct subjectivity ([ 64], p.13). The out-
painted images with those transcorporeal and hybrid figures of
human-nonhuman evocatively raised the question of from where
"I" as a subject starts, and how my craft can be "about thickening
relationality for and with the Earth."([47], p.2).6 CONCLUSIONS
As with other design researchers in the broader HCI community, I
am excited by thinkers in the critical traditions of posthumanism,
critical plant studies and the Anthropocene, but I also find them
difficult to translate into practice within design-oriented fields. Part
of the challenge, as is widely recognized, is the difficulty of decen-
tering the human in a field that is foundationally human-centered.
Another part is the ways that many of us have been taught to
see creativity as a uniquely human quality (though Tsing’s world-
building [ 92] and similar ideas clearly challenge this), and even to
see it as the act of an individual (e.g., the "creative genius" mythol-
ogy around the arts and design), though that, too, has been widely
challenged (e.g., in social psychology [ 24]). In the present work,
rather than staying at the level of abstract theories and attempting
to contribute a new one, I approached these matters in an experi-
ential, embodied, and physical way. There, I cultivated my senses,
thoughts, and outward expressions in a way that reflected the goals,
the desiderata, articulated by this body of theory in those moments
of praxis, where as a design researcher, I have found the practical
utility of this body of theory to remain elusive.
I have tried to communicate here how these experiences have
changed me, but more relevantly to design research, I hope also to
have communicated how these experiences have changed how and
what I make as a design researcher. Above all, I have developed a
novel approach, combining nature walking, journaling, drawing,
outpainting, thematic analysis, and self-reflection. Additionally,
within that approach, I also found shifts in how I act in natural
settings (e.g., leveraging all my senses, intentionally using diverse
points of view); how and what I draw (e.g., moving from a botani-
cal drawing mode to objectively represent plants towards a mode
where I try to receive and depict what they are expressing to me);
how and what I write (e.g., moving from a mode of nature writing
towards a kind of discourse that is more radically reflexive, which
documents ways that plants impress their ways of being onto me,
where I change to accommodate those impressions); and how I use
genAI (e.g., letting its technical inabilities and even hallucinations
challenge my biases and open me to new ways of imagining, new
arts of noticing, the literal contact zones where bodies intermingle,
and where strange worlds are made).
7 LIMITATIONS
This project comes with its own limitations. First, I was not able
to ride my bike to many places. Hence, I used public transporta-
tion and drove my car, which, in addition to using genAI —which
consumes a large amount of energy— contributed to the issues this
research is trying to self-reflexively study. Second, this research
could have been better informed and positioned with regard to the
indigenous knowledge of the land and plants, especially those of
Kumeyyay, Juaneno and Cahuilla. Third, I wish this paper could
reflect the perspectives of African Americans, LGBTQ+ and women
on nature writing, however, and even though they were mentioned
in this work, it may not sufficiently represent their views or their
epistemological commitments. Fourth, although I used my own art
as a member of an underrepresented group, the genAI that I used
was trained on arts of mostly colonial structure, and has reproduced
visibly or invisibly some of those biases and thinking patterns.
