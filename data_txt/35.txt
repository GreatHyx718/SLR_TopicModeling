Abstract
This paper discusses positions taken up by the field of contempo-
rary literacy studies as they relate to digital writing technology.
Literacy studies have not, to our knowledge, been sufficiently exam-
ined from the world of HCI and writing support. We aim to show
that literacy studies as a conceptual framework offers a number of
theoretical challenges to prevailing views of writing that underpin
writing support technology development. We discuss the notions
assemblage and posthuman critical literacy , which may indicate
new research directions for writing support technology in theoret-
ical, artistic, and ideological fronts. Finally, we describe a textual
instrument that demonstrates these ideas.

https://doi.org/10.1145/3690712.3690729Deleuzian philosophy and actor network theory (ANT). ANT is a
theory that posits that interactions between human and non-human
actors alike may be viewed as social relationships, and that humans
and non-humans should be analyzed with symmetrical treatments
[10,15]. Varied criticisms of the theory hold that distinctions be-
tween humans and non-humans (such as this paper’s stance that
human creativity merits special emphasis) acknowledge the value
of the theory “in this age of hybrids and blurred and negotiable
boundaries” [15, 476].
Our position is that this theoretical foundation will be useful
for the computational writing support community to engage with,
not only because its view of writing may provide a more accurate
(though perhaps less precise) theory of writing than than those
currently used in writing tool design, but also that it indicates an
alternative view of writing support technology that values compu-
tational writing aides as a worthwhile aim of technical research
and artistic practice. Borrowing the term from Robinson, the stance
isresistive in that it stands against modes of digital writing infras-
tructure that reduce individual human agency and uphold logics of
power [14].
Engaging in a process similar to research through design [ 6],
which holds that design guidelines are a valuable contribution of
practice-based research, we will describe a speculative design space
for resistive writing technology. As a case study and existence
proof for this class of artifact, we describe ongoing work towards
a textual instrument that fits our speculative design guidelines.
The instrument is philosophically aligned with dadaism, and the
material writing practices of such poets as William Borroughs, Keith
Waldrop, and the automatic writing of W.B. Yates.

2 Understanding Posthuman Literacy
The field of literacy studies has in recent years taken what Bradley
Robinson calls a ‘sociotechnical turn’ in which scholars have “begun
to examine how the technical dimensions of digital technologies
interface with the sociocultural dimensions of literacy in practice”
[14]. This turn is partially inspired by the posthuman philosophy
of Deleuze and Guattari, and emphasizes their concept of assem-
blage , collections of perhaps dissimilar and unrelated things whose
interaction produces “any number of possible effects” [ 11]. Tech-
nologies under this view are not simply tools for the production or
comprehension of texts, but actors within a broader assemblage of
writers, readers, and texts responsible for the production of human
subjectivity [9, 14].
2.1 Identity Formation under the
Computational Unconsciousness
Robinson cites a growing body of research that has raised concerns
about the interaction between automated writing technology (AWT)
and the formation of selfhood. Under a Deleuzian view in which
identity is not fixed, but “hybrid and modulating” (according to
Robinson citing [ 13]), computational processes “do not influence
subjectivity so much as they co-constitute it” [14].
Writing is viewed as a deeply human process, central to the ways
that we understand ourselves. As Robinson quotes of Andrejevic,
writing is “the medium we use to express our “innermost” thoughts”
[2]. Natural language generation (NLG) technology, understood as
a component of the assemblage maintained while writing, takes on
an active agential role in the formation of subjectivity.
As interfaces that utilize large language models (LLM’s) become
commonplace in writing and find their uses in personal writing and
cultural production, their sociocultural biases and cultural idioms
must be understood within the sociotechnical arena. Robinson
adopts Beller’s [ 3] use of the term “computational unconsciousness"
which signifies, rather than a neutral distillation of the collective
beliefs, values, and biases that exist on the internet, a willful product
of capitalist production. In the context of LLM’s, the fingerprint
of corporate neoliberal values is increasingly obvious, as content
moderation policies and decoding algorithms like RLHF explicitly
define the bounds of acceptable production, and will increasingly
factor in their user’s self-expression.
2.2 Writing Technology for Posthuman Critical
Literacy
In light of AI, Leander and Burriss (2020) take the convincing po-
sition that the humanist notion of critical digital literacy is due to
be expanded to a posthuman critical literacy. “[P]osthuman critical
literacy,” they write, “advocates for a shift in understanding our
(human) role in text production and consumption as imbricated in
an assemblage of human and nonhuman actors” [12].
Posthuman critical literacy “necessitates that people can actively
build more ethical assemblages with computational agents” [ 12].
Our position is that this need gives a clear role to technologists and
artists working on AI writing tools. Writing technology designed
for posthuman critical literacy can and should, rather than treat
AI as neutral infrastructure designed to invisibly complement the
goals of the human writer, make their operations legible.Leander and Buriss ask educators to expand from asking “Who
wrote the text, and how does power operate?” to:
•“Where can you identify the influence of computational
agents in the composition and/or distribution of the text?”
•“Who built the computational agent(s), why and how do they
operate?”
•“How do/can we intra-act with computational agents to cre-
ate texts?”
A design space for a class of writing tool designed for posthuman
critical literacy would seek to raise these questions, incorporating
insights from AI explainability research as well as sociological
investigations into the use of AI writing assistance.
2.3 Posthuman Literacy for Writing Technology
At present, cognitive writing theories such as the Flower and Hayes
process model that underpin writing support technology develop-
ment maintain that writers engage in hierarchical stages of writing,
such as transcription or ideation, and approach their text as goal
directed problem solvers [ 5]. Research that utilizes these theories
is meaningful, and has led to increased understanding of how to
develop tools for writing [ 7,8]. As a descriptive endeavor, the
theories provide delineation between highly constrained creative
writing tools (like a stylistic thesaurus) from autonomous writing
technology like Sudowrite. However, perfect taxons have yet to
be proposed. Writing support researchers have come up against
fuzzy boundaries where a writer’s stated goals and a tool’s intended
functionality become blurred. Our position is that contemporary
literacy studies and the theories of writing that constitute them
will be a compliment to the structuralist-leaning models currently
in use.
Hermansson and Saar’s [ 9, 427] application of Deleuzian theory
to writing pedagogy highlights aspects of writing that speak against
the clear phases of the Flower and Hayes model. As they see it, writ-
ers, their texts, and their writing context are in constant interplay,
with writing having “no distinctive start, course, or end. Instead, a
variety of factors are in motion and transformation, thus giving rise
to multiple ways of becoming with the text-in-progress” [ 9]. Their
tenets of writing can be described by the Deleuzian concepts of as-
semblage ,turning points andbecoming-other . We have described the
concept of assemblage; turning points refers to the process by which
trajectories break and diverge, while becoming-other describes how
"the writer is in process with the world", co-constituting it as it
redefines themselves [9].
This cursory discussion is meant to gesture toward the prob-
lems that posthumanist writing theory might unpack. We hope it
will encourage researchers to dig deeper into these theories and
prompt future work into writing technology that makes use of these
perspectives.
3 A Textual Instrument
We turn to a case study meant to operate as an ’existence proof’
of the kind of posthuman writing aides that this line of research
support. Our system is most accurately described as a ‘textual
instrument’, a concept borrowed from Noah Wardrip-Fruin. He
asks “What would it mean to have textual instruments that one
might learn to play proficiently, for which one might write and
66
Designing for Posthuman Critical Literacy In2Writing ’24, May 11, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA
perform a number of compositions, and that could eventually be
made available to play the compositions of others?" [1].
As Wardrip-Fruin saw it, these artifacts were not well understood
as games. They share more in common with musical instruments,
sharing their performative elements. Unlike the textual instruments
envisioned by Wardrip-Fruin, ours is designed to support both
self-contained performative play and solitary operation with the
purpose of assisting in the production of an external artifact. Per-
formance involves the user’s interaction with a MIDI controller,
keypresses mapping to individual words which move across a win-
dow at a fixed rate, before disappearing offscreen.
In this latter mode, playing the instrument functions similarly to
Burroughs’ use of the cut up method of Brion Gysin [ 4]. The player
may learn to understand the complex mapping between key and
word, but due to their limited control of the mapping, play will lead
to the discovery new words and patterns. The phrases and concepts
that emerge are now best understood via the posthuman model, as
textual elements of the writerly assemblage. In its operating mode
as tool, the instrument is designed to support dadaist and automatic
poetry writing, which places value on external texts that may be
re-ingested for the creation of new works. Rather than meant to
’solve’ a specific problem that a writer may bring to it, the oracular
device should be thought of as a complicating entity.
The instrument takes on the resistive elements discussed above
in the ways in which it makes apparent the restricted ability of
players to author texts of their own volition. Each word that the
player can perform is mediated through the constraints of the
system. These constraints can be altered by the user, cycled from
key-to-word mappings that utilize language models to mappings
that simply sample a given source text in deterministic ways. The
system is meant to provoke contemplation about the agency of
the human within the trappings of automated writing technology,
and encourage the user to confront the uncanniness of writing
against the machine. It means to get at the Robinson’s sentiment:
“Unruly language is essential to the unruly subject, a subject at risk
of being ruled by the rules of the operationalized throughput of
NLG technologies” [14].
A more complete description of the instrument’s functionality
is included in the appendix.
4 Conclusion
This short position paper aimed to show that contemporary liter-
acy studies may be usefully applied to the theory of technological
writing support. We hope we have shown that posthuman theo-
ries, representing an expansive view of writing and positioned as
resistive to dominant systems of power, indicate new directions for
writing support research that embraces the full capacity of human
creativity.

A Appendix: Formal Description of the
instrument
Technically, the instrument operates similarly to an audio synthe-
sizer. It is able to receive Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
commands from a MIDI controller such as an electronic keyboard
or MIDI enabled guitar. Rather than producing audio notes, it emits
English words.
When a player-poet presses a key on their controller, a word
appears in a performance window, moving from right to left with
constant velocity. The performance window is divided into a num-
ber of vertically stacked tracks, with a single track surrounded by
a white border indicating it is selected as the track to which the
next played note will be displayed. Each played note advances the
selected track, with the track selector cycling back to the top track
when it reaches the bottom.
The user is able to alter the sampling mode of each track, alter-
ing how the track interprets the incoming MIDI note in order to
render it into a word. We provide a handful of sampling modes to
the user, with more planned. The most basic of these is an index-
based sampler: the MIDI format represents a note’s pitch by an
integer ranging from 0-127, this value is simply used to index into
a user-specified text, which has been broken up into words using
a standard tokenization algorithm. Playing the lowest note on the
controller will display the first word, moving up the keyboard will
play successive words in the text.
Whereas musical notes can be described by features such as pitch,
timbre, and duration (or envelope), the notes of this instrument,
words, are described by morphological features such as denotation
(its direct and literal meaning), connotation (what it implies or sug-
gests) or other features such as its pronunciation and orthography1.
1Words also assume features via their syntactic context. Linguists refer to these proper-
ties as a word’s contextual inflection, contrasted with their inherent inflection (Booij).

Tracks may behave such that they sample with respect for these fea-
tures; one track may sample only verbs while another might move
along a semantically meaningful axis such as emotional valence.
Each track type has a toggle that changes its looping behavior,
controlling what should happen when a word moves off the lefthand side of the window. It may loop back to the right hand side,
resample from the track’s current generating function, or disappear
entirely until a new word is played to the track.
