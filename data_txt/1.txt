Abstract
Purpose –Applications of artificial intelligence (AI), such as virtual and physical service robots, generative
AI, large language models and decision support systems, alter the nature of services. Most service research
centers on the division between human and AI resources. Less attention has been paid to analyzing theentangled resource relations and interactions between humans and AI entities. Thus, the purpose of this paper
is to extend our metatheoretical understanding of resource integration and value cocreation by analyzing
different human –AI resource relations in service ecosystems.
Design/methodo logy/approach –The conceptual paper adapts a novel framework from
postphenomenology, specifically cyborg intentionality. This framework is used to analyze what kinds of
human –AI resource relations enable resource integration and value cocreation in service ecosystems.
Findings –We conceptualize seven different human –AI resource relations, namely background, embodiment,
hermeneutic, alterity, cyborg, immersion and composite relation. The sociotechnical entangled perspective on
human –AI resource relations challenges and reframes our understanding of interactions between humans and
nonhumans in resource integration and value cocreation and the distinction between operant and operand
resources in service research.
Originality/value –Our primary contribution to researchers and service providers is dissolving the
distinction between operant and operand resources. We present two foundational propositions. 1. Humans and
AI become entangled value cocreating resources in inherently sociotechnical service ecosystems; and 2. Human
and AI entanglements in value cocreation manifest through seven resource relations in inherentlysociotechnical service ecosystems. Understanding the combinatorial potential of different human –AI
resource relations enables service providers to make informed choices in service ecosystems.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence [1](AI) applications, such as virtual and physical service robots, are
claimed to alter frontline service ( Wirtz et al., 2018 ;Paluch et al., 2020 ). With its ability to learn,
adapt, connect and exhibit features of human intelligence, AI can act as a customer interface
(Huang and Rust, 2018 ). Therefore, service robots and chatbots represent an increasing share
of frontline service employees. While recent marketing and service research has witnessed anJournal of Service

exponential growth of articles discussing different types of AI applications, such as
generative AI, large language models (LLMs) and decision support systems (DSSs), the
emphasis has been on the division and differences between human and nonhuman actors,
and the AI ’s potential for value cocreation and automation at the task level ( Hottat et al., 2023 ).
The human vs AI dichotomy can be misleading, as it directs the discussion away from
recognizing the combinatorial potential of humans and AI for value cocreation, which takes
place in service ecosystems. In service-dominant (S-D) logic, Vargo and Lusch (2016) refer to
Maglio et al. (2009) and define a service ecosystem as a configuration of people, technologies
and other resources interacting to create mutual value. In information systems literature, the
synergistic assemblage of humans and AI is discussed as augmented intelligence (e.g. Jain
et al., 2021 ) and human –AI collaborative environments ( F€ugener et al., 2022 ). Nevertheless,
despite the recent interest in the topic, the understanding of human –AI augmentation
remains limited ( Teodorescu et al., 2021 ). Further, while AI could augment professionals,
studies on decision-making indicate that technology is not always utilized ( Lebovitz et al.,
2022 ). Recognizing the challenges of studying AI in isolation from humans, Anthony et al.
(2023) and Pakarinen and Huising (2023) shift away from the perspective of AI as a
standalone tool or medium that merely augments human capabilities. Instead, they embrace a
relational perspective, conceptualizing AI as an integral component of the ongoing system of
interactions, where value is cocreated and experienced.
Instead of considering humans and AI as separate actors, the purpose of this paper is to
extend our metatheoretical understanding of resource integration and value cocreation in
service ecosystems by analyzing different human –AI resource relations. Nuanced aspects of
coconstituted and co-dependent resource relations are characteristic of service-dominant
(S-D) logic ( Vargo and Lusch, 2008 ). As resources only exist in relation to other entities,
humans and AI as resources only exist in relation to one another ( Barad, 2007 ;Anthony et al.,
2023 ;Pakarinen and Huising, 2023 ).Kleinaltenkamp et al . (2023) characterize this as
resources becoming entangled within service ecosystems.
Resource integration is driven by intentional and unintentional human behavior (e.g.
Findsrud et al., 2018 ). Traditionally, operant resources were associated with intangible
human attributes, such as explicit and tacit knowledge; operand resources with tangible
(material) resources ( Constantin and Lusch, 1994 ). In S-D logic, Akaka and Vargo (2014) were
forerunners in positioning technology as an operant resource, recognizing that technology,
coupled with knowledge and skills, may play a pivotal role in resource integration. Despitethe increasing number of articles acknowledging the role of technology in value cocreation,
the anthropocentric view that regards humans as the primary knowledge-creating actors and
operant resources in value cocreation has remained dominant. We argue that the dichotomy
between operant and operand resources lacks the conceptual power to explain technology ’s
various roles in value cocreation in service ecosystems (see also Kleinaltenkamp
et al., 2023 ).
In our conceptual paper, we employ theory adaptation ( Jaakkola, 2020 ) to contribute to
service research, broadening the scope and comprehension of resource integration and value
cocreation. We identify various human –AI resource relations in service ecosystems by
incorporating insights from S-D logic and postphenomenology ( Ihde, 1995 ), with a notable
emphasis on cyborg intentionality ( Verbeek, 2008 ;Aydin et al., 2019 ), which studies human –
technology relations. We employ various forms of cyborg intentionality to answer our
research question: What kinds of human –AI resource relations exist in value cocreation in
service ecosystems ? This question assists us in examining the diverse ways in which the
entanglement of humans and AI influences the cocreation and experience of value within
service ecosystems.
As our contribution, we present two propositions for human –AI research in service based
on our theoretical discussion on seven different human –AI resource relations: background ,
embodiment ,hermeneutic ,alterity ,cyborg ,immersion andcomposite relation. First, humansJOSM
and AI become entangled value cocreating resources in inherently sociotechnical service
ecosystems. Here, we extend the recent advancements in S-D logic ( Kleinaltenkamp et al.,
2023 ) by focusing on the particular resource relation between humans and AI. We direct the
attention to entangled resources to guide human –AI research toward acknowledging the
inseparability of humans and AI. This leads to our second proposition: human and AI
entanglements in value cocreation manifest through seven resource relations in inherently
sociotechnical service ecosystems. The seven human –AI resource relations give service
scholars and practitioners a unique perspective, helping them grasp the intricate
entanglement of humans and AI in cocreating value within service ecosystems.
Emphasizing human –AI resource relations offers a more comprehensive perspective on
value creation and service ecosystem evolution than relying solely on humans as operant
resources. We also present future research avenues for service research building on the
identified resource relations. Our managerial implications focus on various human –AI
resource relations and their potential for improved value cocreation.
Human and AI in resource relation and value cocreation
The traditional division between humans and technology, and between operant and operand
resources, has constrained our conceptual understanding of human –technology interactions,
especially regarding human –AI resource relations in service ecosystems. Next, we discuss
two main arguments challenging the human vs nonhuman actor and operant vs operand
resource divisions in human –AI resource relations and value cocreation.
Firstly, service is increasingly cocreated with AI. As a result, the division between humans
and AI has become liminal in value cocreation. For instance, there has been a surge in articles
within service research discussing service robots, chatbots and AI in general. Human-type
service robots have triggered an active discussion (e.g. Pitardi et al., 2022 ), and service robots
are now viewed as a new employee category ( Paluch et al., 2022 ). In S-D logic, Akaka and
Vargo (2014) have applied thinking from science and technology studies, such as actor-
networks ( Callon, 1986 ;Latour, 2007 ), sociotechnical ensembles ( Bijker, 1997 ) or mangles of
practice ( Pickering, 2010 ), which all challenge the traditional dichotomy between humans
(social) and technology (material). Nevertheless, the conceptual basis of human –technology
relations needs to be developed for theory development and practical implications.
Secondly, the rise of sociotechnical ecosystems, which combine social (people) and
technical components in goal-oriented behaviors ( Sony and Naik, 2020 ), also challenges the
established divisions. We contend that service ecosystems are inherently sociotechnical, and
agency emerges from the interaction between various entities, whether members of the biotic
community, inanimate objects, hybrids or their configurations ( Helkkula and Arnould, 2022 ;
Kleinaltenkamp et al., 2023 ;Arnould and Helkkula, 2024 ). Customers sometimes might not
differentiate between interacting with a human or an AI. For example, a chatbot might handle
the initial customer service interaction when booking an airline ticket online. However, if the
query becomes more complex, the chatbot might redirect the customer to a human
“colleague. ”The transition from traditional service to a service that uses AI technology could
be so smooth and unnoticeable that the customer may not even realize or understand to what
degree AI is being utilized by the service provider. Moreover, generative AI, capable of
producing new content (e.g. audio, text, images) based on prompts from humans or software,
has emerged as a cocreator of knowledge in service. This challenges the traditional division
between humans and AI and the practice of attributing agency solely to humans. As a result,
AI should be considered a part of entangled resources in a service ecosystem ( Kleinaltenkamp
et al., 2023 ). As AI does not preexist as an independent actor but emerges from computing
power, algorithms, training data sets and human inquiries, focusing on human –AI resource
relations in value cocreation becomes more meaningful.Journal of Service
Management
Postphenomenological approach to human –AI resource relations
Our study offers a fresh perspective on human –AI resource relations. We draw on the
postphenomenological research tradition ( Ihde, 1995 ;Verbeek, 2008 ), which explores how
technology shapes our perception of the world and influences our behavior. As value
cocreation emerges from entangled human and nonhuman resources, grasping how we study
human experience toward and with technology, here AI is pivotal.
Postphenomenology argues that technologies coconstitute both the subject (actor) and the
world (context). As a result, technology acts as a mediator within this context. For service
research, technology is not simply a tool humans use in the physical world; instead, it
significantly impacts how they interact with the world ( Aydin et al., 2019 ).
S-D logic has a tradition of employing phenomenology to study value cocreation and service
experience ( Vargo and Lusch, 2008 ;Helkkula et al. , 2012 ). Phenomenology focuses on first-
person subjective experiences in a social context. Therefore, phenomenology does not consider
technology to mediate our experiences. Instead, postphenomenology considers that technology
shapes the world, enabling and constraining humans ’ability to know and act in the world
(Goeminne, 2011 ). Technology is characterized by nonneutrality as it displays a particular
intentionality. For instance, AI may affect value cocreation through “smart nudging ”(Mele et al.,
2021), resulting in widened resource accessibility, extended engagement and augmented agency
of human actors. By combining social and technological elements ( Aydin et al. , 2019 ),
postphenomenology emphasizes technology ’s importance in cocreating distinctive resource
relations and contexts of entangled systems for value cocreation. Thus, postphenomenology
enables service researchers and managers to understand how technology as a nonneutral,
entangled resource affects how value is cocreated and experienced.
We use postphenomenology as a method theory ( Jaakkola, 2020 ) to analyze human –AI
resource relations in value cocreation. In a co nceptual paper, a method theory provides the
conceptual framework for studying the dom ain theory. We use postphenomenology ’s recent
conceptualization of intentionality to identify human –AI resource relations in value cocreation in
service ecosystems ( Aydin et al., 2019 ). In earlier postphenomenologi cal research, intentionality
referred to the experiences that arise from an individual ’s attention directed at an event, another
agent or artifacts ( van Manen, 2016 ). For example, Verbeek (2008) —one of the founders of
postphenomenology —ascribed intentionality only to humans. In more recent research, Aydin
et al. (2019) deploy cyborg intentionality as a meta-t erm for technology-mediated, hybrid,
augmented and composite intentionality. Our paper draws on Aydin et al.’s (2019) four types of
cyborg intentionality to rethink human –AI value cocreation in service ecosystems. Within Aydin
et al.’s (2019) framework of the four types of cyborg in tentionality, human and technological
intentionalities intertwine. When human and technological intention alities intertwine, technology
seamlessly integrates with human intentio nalities and becomes a novel contextual “world ”.W e
note that while cyborg intentionality is the meta-term in Aydin et al.’s (2019) framework to define
human technology value coc reation relationships, Aydin et al. (2019) also use the term cyborg to
describe one of the seven types of human –AI cyborg relations they defin e, referring specifically to
the case of human and AI as a hybrid, bionic system.
Aydin et al.’s (2019) cyborg-intentionality framework encourages re-examining human –
AI resource relations, encompassing medi ated, hybrid, augmented and composite
intentionality. Next, we elaborate on these four types of intentionality and the seven
human –AI resource relations: background ,embodiment ,hermeneutic ,alterity ,cyborg ,
immersion andcomposite resource relation.
Mediated intentionality in human –AI resource relations
In mediated intentionality, human intentionality occurs “through ”AI (Ihde, 1995 ;Verbeek, 2008 ).
The four types encompass human –AI background, embodiment, herme neutic and alterity relations:JOSM
In the human –AI background resource relation , AI technologies operate subtly, enhancing
human activities without dominating attention or consciousness. In this relation, AI is a tool
or extension of human abilities, allowing humans to perform tasks more efficiently or
effectively. For example, speech recognition software transcribes speech in real-time, or AI-
powered personal assistants schedule appointments and perform tasks on their users ’behalf.
In the human –AI background relation, people focus on the task or goal accomplished rather
than the technology as long as the AI functions as expected.
The human –AI embodiment resource relation refers to integrating AI technologies with
the human body, enhancing, and influencing human experience and capabilities. This
resource relation integrates technologies with the user ’s body, forging a connection between
humans and their environment. For example, when wearing glasses, the glasses are not
explicitly noticed but are “incorporated ”into the body, becoming an extension of the human
form ( Ihde, 1995 ). This resource relation involves closely integrating technology and the
body, resulting in seamless and constant communication. Examples of the human –AI
embodiment resource relation include wearable smart devices, like sleep and activity trackers
people wear to improve physical abilities.
The human –AI hermeneutic resource relation underscores the importance of interpreting
and understanding the output of AI systems. These technologies provide representations of
reality necessitating interpretation to form a “perception ”—like a thermometer merely
providing a value that must be “read ”to determine something about temperature rather than
producing an experience of hot or cold ( Ihde, 1995 ). AI helps humans interpret complex
datasets and information by applying AI algorithms and models to analyze data and create
predictions. For example, financial analysis and medical diagnosis tools analyze massive
amounts of data to help experts understand the situation. The human –AI hermeneutic
resource relation emphasizes interpretation and comprehension while acknowledging the
influence of human judgment and decision-making on the interaction.
The human –AI alterity resource relation characterizes the interaction between humans
and AI systems, such as service robots. Humans engage with robots as if they are “quasi-
other, ”possessing human-like intentions ( Benjamin, 2023 ). AI appears capable of exerting
agency over its environment on behalf of humans interacting with it. In the human –AI
background resource relations, humans typically notice the AI only when it malfunctions or
ceases to function. In alterity resource relations, technological artifacts become opaque
figures of human experience. Examples of human –AI alterity resource relations include
robots in frontline service.
Hybrid intentionality
The human –AI cyborg resource relation pertains to the fusion of human and AI systems,
culminating in a bionic entity or cyborg. This integration can lead to an increase in human
abilities. Technology and a human become a single, hybrid entity. The lines between humans
and technology are blurred in this relation, unlike in the embodiment relation, where one can
easily (physically) separate human and nonhuman elements. Rather than merely altering the
human perception of the world, technology in human –AI cyborg relations transforms
humans into a novel human –technology hybrid. Examples of human –AI cyborg resource
relations include brain –computer interfaces, AI-powered prosthetics and implantable
medical devices using AI algorithms to regulate the function of internal organs.
Augmented intentionality
In the human –AI immersion resource relation, technology makes an artificially expanded
form of human intentionality accessible. This resource relation describes scenarios where AIJournal of Service
Management
technologies integrate seamlessly with the human environment, influencing human
experiences and perceptions. In contrast to the human –AI background relation, immersion
can be viewed as a more dynamic version where the environment not only senses humans but
actively engages with them ( Vindenes and Wasson, 2021 ). AI is not just a background but an
integral part of the human experience, influencing and nudging behavior and creating a
highly interactive and responsive environment. For instance, AI-based augmented reality
(AR) can produce alternative representations of the world to humans, such as showing the
impact of their intended purchase on the natural environment or spotlighting a product the
customer is most likely to buy in a walk-in store based on the AI ’s real-time data analysis.
Given AI ’s capability to discern emotions and relay information to other technologies,
human –AI immersion resource relations add new layers of meaning and depth to the human
experience and value cocreation processes.
Composite intentionality
In the human –AI composite resource relation , humans and AI collaborate to form a new
hybrid entity, further blurring the line between humans and machines (nonhumans).
Composite intentionality pertains to scenarios where both human intentionality and
technological intentionalities intersect. It entails a dual intentionality: one from technology
directed toward its environment and another from humans toward the results of
technological intentionality. Technological intentionality refers to the deliberate use of
certain technologies to engage with and shape particular facets of the world, such as detecting
sounds inaudible to humans. Here, unlike in cyborg relations, the boundary is solely based on
intentionality, not the physical. The two components coexist in a continuous dynamic loop,
where one ’s output becomes the other ’s input. As a unique perspective, technological
intentionality can reveal realities only accessible via technology ( Verbeek, 2008 ). In simple
terms, humans are attuned to how technology is directed at the world. This type of relation is
common in areas such as human –robot interaction, where service robots work with humans
to accomplish tasks. Through this fusion, humans and AI create a new reality that can only be
experienced in this unique resource relation.
Table 1 summarizes the different forms of cyborg intentionality and gives examples of
human –AI resource relations and cyborg intentionality in value cocreation.
Discussion
Our discussion centers on the sociotechnical entangled perspective of human –AI resource
relations and their potential to cocreate value in service ecosystems. The core of the
sociotechnical perspective encompasses both the social and technical aspects of value
cocreation. We reference Bijker ’s (1997) assertion that in today ’s sociotechnical ecosystems,
human and technological resources can no longer be compartmentalized into separate silos.
"Society is not determined by technology, nor is technology determined by society. Both emerge as
two sides of the socio-technical coin.
Wiebe E. Bijker (1997 , p. 274)
Our study introduces a fresh metatheoretical viewpoint on human –AI resource relations,
underlining AI ’s pivotal function in cocreating value with humans and other entangled
sociomaterial resources. Our contribution is to characterize sociotechnical value cocreation.
In this context, the focus shifts from the human vs AI dichotomy to the value cocreation
emerging from entangled human –AI resources. We present two foundational propositions
capturing the entangled human –AI resource relations in service ecosystems.JOSM
Relation Examples of the human –AI resource relations in value cocreation
Technology-meditated intentionality
Background AI-powered personal assistants: These assistants are designed to perform tasks on behalf of their
users automatically, such as scheduling appointments and sending reminders. By taking care of these
routine tasks, AI-powered personal assistants free up time for humans to focus on more important
tasksPredictive maintenance systems: These AI systems are used in manufacturing plants and other
industrial settings to monitor equipment and predict when maintenance is needed. By detecting
potential issues before they become major problems, predictive maintenance systems allow humans
to take proactive measures and prevent downtime
Embodiment Sleep and activity trackers: These devices are physically integrated into the human body. They track
sleep and activity patterns and by analyzing the data extend the human body ’s capabilities. They
make it easier to track health and wellness, and provide real-time information and feedback, which
influences human decision making and experienceSmart clothing: This technology integrates sensors, conductive materials, and wireless
communication to create clothing that can sense and react to the wearer and its environment. Smart
clothing can be used in a variety of contexts, from athletic performance tracking to medical
monitoring, rehabilitation and personal protection
Hermeneutic Financial analysis: AI is used to analyze vast amounts of financial data and generate predictions and
recommendations for investment decisions. This human –AI hermeneutic resource relation allows for
more effective and efficient investment strategies, while also ensuring that human judgment and
decision-making remain central to the processPersonalized education: AI systems can analyze student performance data and generate personalized
recommendations and resources to help students achieve their learning goals. This human –AI
hermeneutic resource relationship allows for more personalized and effective learning experiences,while also ensuring that human educators remain central to the process
Alterity Service robots: Humans engage with service robots as if they possessed human-like intentions and
capabilities. Typical to human –AI alterity resource relation, service robots appear to exert agency over
their environment on behalf of th e humans interacting with them
Autonomous vehicles: Various autonomous vehicles are able to navigate and respond to their environment.As a result, people can rely on them as drivers freeing humans to focus on other tasks
Hybrid intentionality
Cyborg Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs): This technology allows humans to control various technologies
using their thoughts, thereby blurring the boundary between human and technology. Humans cancontrol, for instance, prosthetic limbs, computers or even wheelchairs with BCIs. This human –AI
cyborg resource relation allows humans to achieve greater control over their environment while
reshaping our very understanding of what it means to be humanImplantable medical devices: AI algorithms may be used to monitor and regulate the function of
internal organs, thereby transforming human health. Individuals may have implantable devices
that monitor their health in real-time and adjust their activities accordingly. For instance, an
individual with a heart condition may have a device that monitors their heart rate and uses AI to
detect and prevent dangerous arrhythmias. This human –AI cyborg resource relation allows
individuals to maintain their health and well-being, while also relying on technology to do so,
offering new avenues for controlling and managing human health
Augmented intentionality
Immersion Smart homes: AI technology can create a completely personalized and immersive environment
for humans. By analyzing previous behavior and preferences, AI can adjust lighting,
temperature, and music, making the living space responsive to the inhabitant ’s needs.
Additionally, AI can interact with humans through voice-activated commands, assisting withdaily activities and providing a responsive envi ronment that makes living more efficient and
enjoyable
AI-powered virtual reality: When VR is powered by AI algorithms, there is an entirely new worldfor humans to explore. The environment generated by AI is incredibly realistic, and intelligent
virtual characters respond to human behavior , enhancing the immersive experience. The line
between reality and virtual reality becomes blurred as the interactive and responsiveenvironment mimics the real world

1. Humans and AI become entangled value cocreating resources in inherently
sociotechnical service ecosystems.
So far, S-D logic has yet to emphasize the pivotal role of AI in value cocreation. With this
proposition, we argue that AI not only has a mediating role in value cocreation ( Vargo, 2018 ).
Assessing humans and AI as entangled resources in inherently sociotechnical service
ecosystems is meaningful. When AI is present with its ability to display intelligent behavior, the
dynamics of human interactions with resources change compared to interactions with non-AI
technology. This has important implications for managing service ecosystems, emphasizing the
need to recognize the increased role of human –AI relations alongside human efforts. What we
add to existing cocreation research is that AI can act on humans just like humans act on other
humans and technologies in service ecosystems. Furthermore, we question the human-centered
understanding of only human beings as knowledge-creating, resource-integrating actors and
claim that human –AI resources are increasingly taking this role. This is imperative as value
increasingly emerges from human –AI resource relations. Even when we think about a human-
centered, manual service, such as a haircut, AI often mediates the experience along the customer
journey. For instance, when booking the service, a customer may ask the iPhone Siri (human –AI
alterity relation): “Where is a barber store open nearby? ”.
Postphenomenology offers a framework for understanding human –AI resource relations
from various aspects. To continue the barber example, the customer whose hair was manually
cut pays the bill using a payment system mediated by the AI (human –AI background resource
relation). Thus, from the service provider ’s side, either a person, an AI application, or their
combination can take care of the payment. Even these simple examples indicate that the
distinction between entangled human –AI resource relations is never clear-cut. Our theoretical
discussion and examples show how postphenomenology, particularly cyborg intentionality, can
advance a service ecosystems approach to replace a human vs AI and the operant vs operand
dichotomies in service research. We indicate how intentionality is not conceptually meaningful
to solely assign to humans or AI but to the entangled resources ( Barad, 2007 ;Orlikowski, 2007 ;
Kleinaltenkamp et al., 2023 ). In our managerial implications, we will further elaborate on the
specific postphenomenological resource relations for value cocreation.
2. Human and AI entanglements in value cocreation manifest through seven resource
relations in inherently sociotechnical service ecosystems.
Resource integration in sociotechnical ser vice ecosystems is not human vs AI but includes
human –AI resource relations. Service ecosyst em elements are connected to a shared
purpose, where physical and AI elemen ts are architecturally designed ( Mele et al. , 2010 ;Relation Examples of the human –AI resource relations in value cocreation
Composite intentionality
Composite Generative AI: The field of generative AI allows humans and machines to collaborate and create new
forms of art, music and research. A musician, for example, can use an AI system to generate new
melodies, and then modify and expand upon them to produce a unique, hybrid composition thatblends the human touch with machine-generated creativity
Medical diagnosis: In some medical specialties, such as radiology, AI systems are used to aid human
doctors in making diagnoses. The AI system analyzes medical images and provides suggestions tothe doctor, who then makes the final decision based on their medical knowledge and expertise. This
human –AI composite resource relation results in a collaborative diagnosis that combines the
strengths of both human and machine input, ultimately leading to more accurate diagnoses andimproved patient outcomes
Source(s): The content of the table was created by the authors, utilizing OpenAI ’s ChatGPT for original ideation
Table 1.JOSM
Mele and Russo-Spena, 2022 ). Therefore, designing value co creation focuses on facilitating
intended value cocreation for service provid ers and customers. Resourcing the intended
value cocreation can be designed using different human –AI resource relations. For
example, a fast-food takeaway restaurant o ffers two kinds of food ordering and pick-up
options: a customer can stand in line and order food at the counter (human –human) or via a
voice app in their wristwatch (human –embodied AI), get home delivery by a food delivery
firm (human –background AI), or a service robot delivery (human –alterity AI).
These examples are positive human –AI resource relations. The two sides of the
sociotechnical coin include the tremendous potential for new types of service innovations on
one side and risks and threats on the other. For example, AI-powered autonomous vehicles
can be safe and comfortable but raise people ’s fears, which may cause reluctance to adopt the
service ( Meyer-Waarden and Cloarec, 2022 ). Moreover, certain AI-based innovations, like
autonomous military drones ( Dyndal et al., 2017 ), are perceived as threats to humanity. This
underscores the need to recognize human –AI resource relations and revisit ethical guidelines
and legislation. Ethical considerations extend beyond concerns about threats to humanity in
human –AI interactions. They also encompass issues such as accountability and
transparency regarding the utilization of AI within service ecosystems. We anticipate our
work will illuminate the intricate dynamics of these entangled human –AI resource relations,
aiding in addressing these challenges. Next, we discuss some possible future research topics
that could advance human –AI resource relations in value cocreation.
Future research agenda for service research
Postphenomenology, particularly cyborg inte ntionality, provides a unique foundation for
researching human –AI resource relations in value cocreation. We delineate future research for
advancing service research within thre e interconnected areas: (1) studying human –AI resource
relations in service, (2) advancing understanding of human –technology resource relations and (3)
conceptualizing agency and intentionality in service ecosystems. Table 2 lists potential research
questions for service research encompassing al l three areas. In sociotechnical ecosystems,
individual and collective social factors are relevant to all human –AI resource relations. When
designing for human –AI value cocreation, it is vital to incorpo rate networks of actors, rules, social
norms and institutions into the process ( Vargo and Akaka, 2012 ;Vink et al., 2021 ).
Studying human –AI resource relations in service
Our study initiates a new approach to studying the roles of humans and AI in resource
integration and value cocreation in service ecosystems. We need more research that does not
simply draw a line between humans and AI but explores the consequences when these
boundaries become indistinct. We call for studies to uncover how various human –AI resource
relations impact the service frontline, which can be approached from the perspective of
customers and frontline employees. The implications of this integration extend beyond the
frontline. Further studies are needed to explore the influence of human –AI resource relations
on areas ranging from actor engagement to market shaping and transformative service
research. In empirical research, the effect may be contextually sensitive; hence, we need more
studies to uncover the role of the cultural context in shaping human –AI resource relations.
Further, there is a need to understand the ethical and social implications of the blurring
boundaries between humans and AI in service ecosystems.
Advancing understanding of human –technology resource relations
This study purposefully focuses on AI as a technology. We recognize that our decision limits
the direct applicability of our work beyond human –AI resource relations. Therefore, we inviteJournal of Service

other scholars to employ postphenomenology as a method theory to further our general
understanding of human –technology resource relations. More studies are needed to
understand how AI stands apart from other technologies in value cocreation. For example,while AI is capable of autonomous decision-making, other technologies do not possess this
skill. Thus, service scholars might explore how other human –technology resource relations
impact value cocreation. These questions could influence not just service research but also
other disciplines. For example, Hoffman and Novak (2018) observed that the recognizedRelation

emergence of consumer-object assemblages prompts new inquiries and suggests broadening
the scope of consumer behavior.
Conceptualizing agency and intentionality in service ecosystems
As service researchers move from a human-centric approach to a sociotechnical perspective
on value cocreation, they will encounter new questions about resources and actors. For
example, we need to deepen our understanding of agency and intentionality within service
ecosystems and evaluate the significance of these conceptual terms. The merging of humans
and technology into bionic beings or cyborgs further obscures the distinction between
humans and technology. As these boundaries blur, it becomes crucial to comprehend how
institutions shape human –AI relations and the consequent impacts. This understanding
could aid programmers and service designers enhance AI ’s contextual sensitivity within
service ecosystems. Given that AI ’s self-awareness in its autonomous decisions contrasts
with human reflexivity, there is a pressing need for more research on agentic technology
(Murray et al. , 2021 ). The challenges posed by AI technology bring forth ethical and legal
issues, especially when the line between human and nonhuman agency becomes blurred
(Kleinaltenkamp et al., 2023 ). Further, the dark side of AI opens up intriguing research
avenues.
Our two propositions adopt a metatheoretical perspective on human –technology resource
relations, explicitly focusing on human –AI resource relations. We neither build models for
specific human types or roles, such as customer or employee, nor particular AI applications or
methods, such as image recognition or recommendation systems. Using the S-D logic lexicon:
it’s all human –AI.
Managerial implications
As the cocreation environment evolves with new technology, service providers need to
remain agile and responsive to customers ’needs. The perception of people and AI as
entangled resources in value cocreation necessitates reconfiguring resource integration.
Thus, understanding what kind of human –AI resource relations exist and what type of value
cocreation processes can be designed is essential. We introduce a postphenomenological
approach to human –AI value cocreation, outlining managerial responsibilities across four
main types and their sub-types, as detailed in Table 3 . Managers can use this approach to
have a better understanding of alternative human –AI resource relations and rethink the roles
of humans and AI in value cocreation. When service experience is understood as AI-mediated,
managers can start experimenting, how various AI technologies can contribute to service
provision as well as how they impact the perceived service experience in various contexts.
Through this experimentation, managers can find human –AI resource relations that cocreate
value in service ecosystems.
Human –AI resource relations do not always yield positive outcomes. Emphasizing the
relationality of humans and AI in service ecosystems, we argue that the negative impact does
not depend solely on the quality of the AI component. Value cocreation is also dependent on the
capabilities and other characteristics of a human in the human –AI resource relation, as well as
institutional arrangements of service ecosystems. Sometimes, institutions may need to be altered
to embrace certain human –AI resource relations, such as brain-computer interfaces and
implantable medical devices. This kind of institutional work requires managers to be aware of
existing institutional arrangements, such as legislation and norms in medical practice, and
capable of changing them through service ecosystem design ( Vink et al., 2021 ).
In the first AI-mediated value cocreation type, AI is an entangled resource that mediates
human experience. Table 3 further inventories four sub-types: background, embodied,Journal of Service
Management
hermeneutic (knowledge process), and alterity (a new type of “other ”). Embodied wearables
and “other ”frontline employees, such as robots ( Odekerken-Schr €oder et al. , 2022 ) and
chatbots ( Mozafari et al. , 2022 ), can cocreate positive and negative customer experiences,
depending on the service frontline setting. Therefore, a new type of value cocreation requires
strategic reorientation to retain customers in changing conditions.
In the second type, hybrid human –AI value cocreation, a customer and AI merge
physically. For instance, this type offers cocreation possibilities for healthcare service
providers when a chip is implanted into the body for monitoring purposes. Here, the AI ’s role
is physically different from the first type, which can lead to new legal and ethical challenges
that managers need to consider.
In the third type, AI-augmented value cocreation, the human and AI merge virtually. AR
and virtual reality (VR) are also used in health care, such as in surgeries and physical therapy,
but their usage could be, and most probably will be, expanded to various other use cases soon.
While AR and VR enhance reality, AR provides physical world enhancements, e.g. projecting
an anatomy chart on a patient; VR detaches the user from the physical world. AR, VR, and the
combination of mixed reality (MR) enable a new type of service cocreation reality ( De Keyser
et al., 2019 ). Here, managers can consider how human –AI resources can work together in a
virtual world to cocreate value.
In the fourth type, the AI composition resource relation refers to value cocreation, which
would be outside human experience without AI. For instance, AI-powered computational
imaging may generate a picture of an ancestor by combining various data points. This resource
relation provides opportunities for value cocreation that often extend beyond our current human
imagination, enabling unique opportunities for those who can build on these relations.1. Mediation: entangle AI as a resource that mediates customer experience
Background AI 1. Establish an environment or servicescape that facilitates value cocreation. 2. Customize

opportunities for

cocreationJOSM
Table 3 presents the different entangled human –AI resource relations and their potential
for resource integration and value cocreation. Understanding the possible human –AI value
cocreation types enables service providers to make conscious choices in their specific service
context. We advise a strategic assessment of which types or mixtures offer fresh perspectives
on resource integration and value cocreation, considering the possible impacts on customer
experiences.
We claim that when designing resource integration, extending operant human resources
to entangled combinations of humans and AI is imperative. The human –AI value cocreation
types can assist managers to design different human –AI combinations and understand their
potential for improved value cocreation.
Conclusion
In this metatheoretical study, we adapt a novel framework from postphenomenology,
specifically cyborg intentionality, and introduce seven entangled human –AI resource
relations. While the dominant discussion in service research has focused on how humans use
and experience AI in service, we take a broader sociotechnical view of AI. This enables us to
realize different human –AI value cocreation potentials in service ecosystems.
We claim the conventional division of human and nonhuman actors, such as AI in value
cocreation, must be questioned and repositioned within the relational sociotechnical
understanding of technology. Given the increasingly blurred resource relations between
people and AI, research and practice should avoid overly celebrating or dramatizing risks in
using AI in service.
By presenting various cyborg intentionality and resource relation types, we help scholars
in service research and beyond to study value cocreation by entangled human –AI resource
relations in service ecosystems (e.g. F€ugener et al., 2022 ;Lebovitz et al., 2022 ;de Vericourt and
Gurkan, 2023 ). We argue that to understand AI ’s full potential and recognize the challenges it
creates for ethical principles and legislation, it is imperative to consider AI as a pivotal part of
resource integrating and value cocreating service ecosystems. We encourage future research
to examine the specific potentials and challenges of the seven different human –AI resource
relations in sociotechnical value cocreation in service ecosystems.
