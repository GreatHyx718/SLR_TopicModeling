Abstract
This paper explores the aesthetic value shifts required for sustain-
able design of so called ‘high-tech’ products, highlighting an in-
creasing down-to-earth ethos within the field. Using a spaceship
metaphor and drawing from principles of post-industrial design
and visions for long-term sustainable transformation, a high-level
analysis is presented of how grassroot activist cultures and alterna-
tive tastemaking practices are currently steering designs towards
the systemic, earthy and organic. This direction is illustrated by
diverse examples from within the TEI discourse that investigates
new material approaches and that critically challenge conventional
aesthetic orientations. While such approaches can be criticized
for insufficiently addressing interactive and electronic components,

https://doi.org/10.1145/3689050.3704935interaction design for sustainability [see e.g. 2,3], with the theme
of Human-Computer Interaction for Sustainability now a flourish-
ing research area of its own, and we see how social, ethical and
environmental concerns have been increasingly recognized also
within more technology-oriented fields like TEI. Here, we discuss
some of the aestheticorientations and approaches to sustainability
in works presented within this academic discourse and discuss its
broader implications for design as well as for theory. The term
aesthetics is here used as is common in interaction design, with
attentiontoconceptssuchasuserexperience[seee.g, 10,32,39,50],
at interplay with varied and shifting cultural norms. While aes-
thetics is sometimes implied as an insignificant surface layer of
interactive products, it is fundamentally shaped by as well as shap-
ing cultural contexts, with powerful ethical implications [ 38]. It is
thus an embedded quality of our world and the futures we hope for,
and therefore affects the shapes and materials of the designs we
produce, as well as the lifestyles and practices we want our design
efforts to fit into.
TEI is fundamentally concerned with ‘high-tech’, by studying,
developing, and showcasing designs at the cutting edge of interac-
tive technology. Here we use the Spaceship as a metaphor for the
design discourse in this research area. Stemming from the space
age era of the 1960s, it is no coincidence that high-tech design has
often spoken to us using a sci-fi inspired visual language. Also,
conceptually for the topic of sustainability, the spaceship doubles
as a longstanding metaphor for understanding systemic and envi-
ronmental dependencies, as in Buckminster Fuller’s concept of the
‘Spaceship Earth’, established within that era [10]].
Asanyresearchdomainofdesignorengineering, thefieldofTEI
idealizes the new, and in a sense therefore also the short-lived, and
many have argued that this general culture of short-termism is one
of the main causes of the current instability of the world [see e.g.
27,41]. As famously phrased by Arturo Escobar [ 19], we need “a
significantreorientationofdesignfromthefunctionalist,rationalistic,
and industrial traditions from which it emerged, and within which it
stillfunctionsatease,towardsatypeofrationalityandsetofpractices
attuned to the relational” (p42). Considerations for sustainability
have a long tradition in the design discourse [ 50], even within the
early modern movement [ 20], yet it cannot be neglected how the
very principle of mass production, which still governs much of
industrial design, has had significant impact on our research field
and the contemporary world as we know it.

ThenotionofPost-IndustrialDesignwasintroducedaround1980,
asdesigntheoristNigelCross[ 13]arguedthatthe‘hyperexpansion-
ist’ Modern Movement approach to design had to be phased out.
This new approach would entail a resource-conserving attitude to
materialsandproduction,itwouldadvancequalityandpromote “so-
cial and economic life reorganised in small-scale units” [ 7, p. 6].This
could be said to represent a call for re-uniting the craft disciplines
with design, and a revival of the so-called Arts and Crafts move-
ment, which from within the crafts field since more than a century
had represented an ongoing cultural resistance to the industrial de-
sign project. The concept of crafting had become increasingly seen
as a form of hobby, folk art, or as a playful school activity among
children, and the post-industrial design ideals brought with it a
re-appreciation of traditional crafts as precious [68].Now, almost
half a century later, this notion of post-industrial design appears
more relevant than ever. The post-industrial design ideals, as ar-
ticulated above and by many others since, can be seen reflected
both on the contemporary arts scene [ 9,60], in subculture [ 57], and
even in the commercial sector. It has clear parallels to the so-called
‘makermovement’[ 18], callsforlocal-, environmental-andsocially
just production [ 58], and the large amount of low-tech crafts pop-
ularly shared and showcased via online platforms such as Etsy,
Instructables, TikTok and Instagram. Attention to the handmade
is also present in a variety of contemporary design styles, such
as wabi-sabi [ 72], steampunk [ 66], neo retro [ 75], and bricolage
[72]. At the yearly TEI conferences, we observe an ever-growing
enthusiasm for projects related to manual crafts, such as bamboo
weaving[ 24], stainedglasswork[ 23], shoemaking[ 45], andcrochet
[26].
A shift away from modernist ideals in early HCI research (man-
ifested e.g. in its focus on single user interfaces and search for
objectively optimal solutions) has in TEI previously been mani-
fested as a reorientation of design values towards the pragmatic,
material, social, and subjective [ 22]. A main insight highlighted by
Fernaeus et al in 2008 [ 22] was for instance that designers need to
acknowledge a world more complex than is often assumed, yet they
did not bring attention to the environmental disruptions caused by
technology, and neither did they reflect on the entanglements of
other-than-human lifeforms as part of interactive contexts. A simi-
lar critique was formed in van Dijk et al’s ‘Radical Clashes’ [ 14],
highlighting the gap in orientation between research stemmingfrom a human-centred design perspective, and research conducted
from a perspective of engineering. Brenda Laurel [ 40] later pro-
posedthatdesignworkshouldbegroundedinanawarenessthatwe
belong to the biosphere, and in which ‘Technology is not the other’
and‘Natureisnottheother’. LentonandLatour[ 41]similarlyhigh-
lighted how, rather than focusing on relationships between specific
organisms, the ambition should be to maintain a ‘planetary-scale
self-regulating system’.
Brought into design practice, these new principles could hold
an enormous potential in the drive towards long-term sustainable
transformations, a theme we currently see many research projects
grappling with. Some well-known conceptual explorations include
‘Eternally Yours’ [ 49], ‘Technology Heirlooms’ [ 35], ‘Gaian IxD’
[40], ‘Interaction Design Otherwise’ [ 15,25], and ‘Wanting to live
here’ [5]. More concretely we see growing number of projects that
explicitly engage with other-than-human entanglements, not only
withplantsandanimals[ 2,34,36,47,74],butalsoluminescentalgae
[31],bacteria[ 56],yeast[ 8],mold[ 53],andevenhumanbodyfluids
[29], as parts of interactive systems. The use of organic and bio-
based materials is seen both as surface materials and for interactive
functions, but also as core contextual elements or as props for
staging design to be set in warm and liveable environments. This
essay follows directly upon these developments, by a more explicit
focus on what these works might bring to our understanding of
aesthetics in relation to long-term sustainable transformations.
2 Background
In Jeffrey Bardzells introduction to the practice of Interaction Crit-
icism from 2011 [ 4], he used the then contemporary, now classic,
tangible interaction design exemplar Lumino [7] as an example
case for critique. In his analysis, Bardzell brought to light some
obvious but rarely discussed aspects of interaction design from a
perspective of visual aesthetics, including the inherent masculine
coding of a cold blue colour scheme, and its sleek and geometric
forms. The analysis revealed a deep aesthetic preference, prevalent
also in much previous works in the field, coded with similar visual
expressions. From the Metadesk [ 32], to G-Speak, famous from
Steven Spielberg’s 2002 science fiction film Minority Report [ 63], to
InForce [ 46] and Radical Atoms [ 33] – they all display a preferred
taste for translucent objects set in dark rooms, illuminated by tech-
nology(seeFigure1). Thoughthisfamilyofprojectswereoriginally

described as a reaction against the standard desktop paradigm of
the time, as in Underkoffler’s notion of ‘Antisedantory Beigeless
Computing’ [71], it can also be argued to reflect a self-image of
technology as detached from natural ecosystems.
Here,wewouldliketopointouthowthisshapingofa‘high-tech
taste’, which was so prevalent in many of the early TEI exemplars,
holds some clear aesthetic parallels to the dystopian style of the
‘Cyberpunk’, and that the Minority Report did not depict a future
anyonewashopingfor. TheaestheticsoftheCyberpunk,developed
asasci-fiinspireddesignstyleduringthe1990s,tightlyfollowedthe
legacy of early industrial ideals, with a machine aesthetics drawing
directly on modernist visions of the future [62]. At a surface level
one may see this reflected in much of early HCI work as a tendency
to scientize certain forms, promoting e.g. geometrical shapes above
ornamentation, and adverse attitude to colour (see e.g. [ 6]). The
design ideals of the cyberpunk aesthetics were challenged already
by Kathrine Hayles in 1999, proposing alternative visions of the
posthuman, not to be ‘seduced by fantasies of unlimited power’ [28].
In contrast, the science fiction genre of Solarpunk [ 55,76] repre-
sents an aesthetic ideal that imagines an optimistic future in which
our current problems have been successfully solved. Recurring
technologiesinthesevisionsincludesolarpanels,solarovens,wind-
mills, vertical gardens, bicycles, earthships, greenhouses, aquapon-
ics, and technology being repaired, repurposed and reused. As a
contemporary design style, Solarpunk has been most influential in
architecture, where instead of lifeless glass and steel, the designers
look forward to shared gardens, crafted woodwork, and cosy textile
interiors (see illustrations in Figure 2). In interaction design we
can see this aesthetic traced visually in surface appearances and
layouts, and in the many niche projects concerned with nature,
gardening and (inter)personal care, as already mentioned above.
In particular, we would like to point to a growing range of de-
sign exemplars that expose technology alongside and interwoven
with green plants, organic materials, the outdoors, and rudimen-
tary everyday use contexts populated by people. Importantly, this
tendency appears not limited to technology but also other areas
of design. Compare Breuer’s iconic Bauhaus chair ‘Wassily’ from
1925, with the contemporary ‘Green Hideaway Chair’ , by European
design agency Front in collaboration with the DIY chain Hornbach,
from 2023 (see Figure 3). The two pieces represent fundamentally
different ideals in terms of production, use, and visual appearance,
butperhapsmostprominentlyinitsrelationshipto theliving ,where
the hideaway chair doubles as a climbing structure for a live plant,
growing from under its seat. Designed along with instructions for
construction and assembly, it also elevates the value of the homebuilt as a form of local production, and downplays, or overrides,
the value of the factory-made.
One could see the above developments as a parallel to how no-
tionsaroundtheposthumanhavesweptoverHCIindifferentwaves.
The first wave in the late 1990s, in critiques of the sci-fi inspired
discourse of the time, articulating cognition as distributed, em-
bodied, and situated through thinkers like Katherine Hayles [ 28],
Lucy Suchman [ 64], Lakoff and Johnson [ 39]. Many of the princi-
ples of tangible and embodied interaction stem from these ideas.
In the late 2010s, we began to see a second wave of emphasizing
more-than-human designs as an approach to sustainable futures
of interactive systems, now drawing more extensively on feminist
new materialist scholars such as Donna Haraway [ 27], Karen Barad
[3], and Rosi Braidotti [ 10]. While the first wave worked to most
part as a counter-reaction to the disembodied ideals of the early
computer era, the contemporary discourse on posthuman HCI is
coming from a broader philosophical discourse of new materialism,
eco feminism, and postcolonial studies. Our current discourse of
TEI provides an exciting blend of these different strands, one focus-
ing more on designing for human practice, while the latter takes
on a broader eco-social perspective, focusing more on relations
and interferences. Both strands however share the fundamental
grounding in human experience and survival as deeply situated
in the material world. In the following, we will try to articulate
how these ideas are reflected concretely in contemporary design
directions.
3 Returning to “Eternally Yours”
Back in the late nineties, about the same time as the rise of the con-
ceptoftangibleinterfaces[ 32],VerbeekandKockelkoren[ 49],listed
four possible strategies for sustainable product design: 1) to focus
on services, e.g. repairing and renting, instead of new products, 2)
eco-design,i.e. minimisepollutionthroughoutaproduct’slifecycle,
3) recycling, of the whole product and its components, and 4) work-
ing to expand a product’s life span. While their mission focused on
the final point through a design vision called ‘Eternally Yours’, all
four strategies are still relevant pointers to revisit in the context of
sustainable tangible and embodied interaction design. How may
these seemingly simple principles translate to the contemporary
world of advanced high-tech products, and our felt experiences in
the interaction with such artefacts? How might current theories
around eco-social entanglements resonate with these design princi-
ples, and how might they interconnect with ongoing tastemaking
practices and aesthetic ideals? Below follows an overview of how

Chair’, by ©Hornbach in collaboration with Front Design, 2023.
contemporary works approach each of these strategies. Thereafter
follows an analysis of how these approaches can be understood
through a broader lens of aesthetics in contemporary culture.
3.1 Services
The first strategy highlighted by Verbeek and Kockelkoren was
to focus design efforts on services such as repairing and renting,
instead of mere production of new physical products. This res-
onates directly with current principles of the sharing economy,
which blends interaction design, typically via smartphone apps and
connected devices, with people, places and physical things. Devel-
opment of such services are now tightly intertwined with physical
productdesign. Thismeansthatbeyond‘meresoftware’, servicesto
support shared use of the product is now often an inherent part of
thephysicaldesign,witheverydayexamplessuchassmartspeakers
used in families and at social gatherings, electronic house locks,
communal eBikes with mechanical functionality connected to on-
line payment models, and a variety of ticketing solutions used for
public transport. One may argue that today’s electronic products
are indeed as much about services as of production of goods.
There are still many wicked problems surrounding this setup,
ranging from everyday media devices losing their functionality due
to unforeseen changes in the media landscape, to horror stories of
users of medical prostheses being ripped off their new body parts
as MedTech startups lost their funding for continued maintenance
[59]. The types of services that Verbeek and Kockelkoren talked
about were aligned more specifically to the sharing economy in a
pre-smartphone world, and the current reality highlights that new
troubles have appeared. Perhaps most paradoxically, despite this
abundance of services, people in our service-oriented and so-called
post-industrial society still use up much more resources than any
other civilization [40].
Theseexampleshighlighthow,comparedtothedaysofEternally
Yours, today’s design efforts take place in fluid assemblages of
connected devices and services [ 54], with for instance a connected
loudspeaker requiring not only an internet connection but also auser account for some of its operations, and a subscription to a
music library service for other operations, which in turn requires a
smartphonewithassociatedapplications,connectionsandaccounts.
These are fundamental features of most current high-tech gadgets,
and which every interaction designer in this domain will need to
be adjusted towards.
Designing for shared use has indeed been a fundamental theme
in much research at TEI, not least at works concerned with the
design of physical interactions in real world settings, but attention
to how these technologies align with online services has remained
relatively limited. Yet the steady flow of initiatives for sharing- and
circular use holds much potential in terms of sustainable use of
advancedtechnology. Thecurrenttheoreticalemphasisonrelations
is exactly in line with this understanding, which will bring more
weight to how the interplay between service designs in the real
world may hinder or promote long-term sustainable use practices
with and around high-tech products.
3.2 Eco-design
The strategy of eco design aims to minimise pollution from a prod-
uct’s entire life cycle through e.g. the use of organic materials, local
production, and minimized waste during use, packaging and trans-
portation. As repeatedly reiterated within the discourse of TEI, the
design of computer systems can be claimed to fundamentally be
about the shaping of electrical currents (bits) [ 70]. Yet, the default
context for design within this field has until recently been based
on conventional, industrial ways of living, with assumptions of,
for instance, an endless and affordable supply of energy, for the
shaping of bits, and for manufacturing of tangible elements [30].
One of the main concerns for TEI is tangible interaction, i.e.
interactive systems that are partially based on graspable items,
such as cards, blocks, dolls, pens, and other physical objects, which
forms a design space that historically has covered some of the most
innovative, but also some very mundane forms of interactions. One
ofthemostcommon,yetundistinguished,usesofsuchtechnologies
can be found in NFC tags used for physical access and payment,

ranging from plastic cards to key fobs, to wearable accessories such
as bracelets or rings. An important use quality of such ‘passive
tangibles’, is that they do not need to charge nor store energy,
although they do require active sensing of other networked devices,
e.g., cameras, readers, software and servers, during the moment
of use. In Figure 4, we see two examples of passive tangibles in
the form of a wooden NFC tag (B), and an electronic door key (C),
in which also the lock itself is manually powered by the manual
interaction with the key. Another form of passive tangible is the
ubiquitous QR code, and last year’s TEI conference showcased at
least two explorations of such, one printed in mold by [ 53] and
the Dataslip installation [ 48], in which a simple receipt printout
broughtlighttoaneveryday, low-techmodeofengagingphysically
with electronic data. These simplistic, low energy, low key designs
point to an aesthetic attitude that does not have in its interest to
impress by grandiosity or novelty effect, but by practical, useful
and meaningful functionality, caring for its immediate contexts of
use as well as to its planetary impact.
Regarding the physical we see a range new electronic prod-
ucts covered in recycled plastic, cardboard, and organic materials
like leather and bamboo [ 78] (See Figure 4a, for just one everyday
example). In research, this is mirrored by an extensive range of
explorations working with biomaterials, traditional crafts and bio-
philicforms. Achallengeappearstobemovingbeyondthephysical

environmental challenges remain at the dealing with rare metalsrequired for processing and powering of electronic components,
and how these can be ethically produced and deployed.
Beyond the tangible, the enormous amounts of electricity re-
quired for e.g. data storage, online media streaming, mining of
crypto currencies, and training of machine learning algorithms is a
concernregularlybroughtupinpopularmedia. Thisiscontradicted
in design with the concept of ‘the cloud’ that might on the one
hand appear to promisefree, unlimited, and permanent storage, but
that costs enormous resources to maintain, with damaging effects
on both human health and the environment. This failed promise
has inspired designs that value the ephemeral as a use quality [ 17],
which we also can see in commercial successes like Snapchat [ 69].
The ethical implications around the manual labour involved in e.g.
the data labelling for generative AI systems, are other important
topics in current debate, again grounded in the under-discussed
material basis of interactive systems [37].
This theme of energy as an element of eco design also highlights
the values and possibilities of working with e.g. manually powered
devices. Instead of using energy to e.g. bike to a store to purchase
new batteries (and manufacturing new batteries, and building and
maintaining electrical power plants), simple electronic systems can
be powered by the users’ interactions, e.g. the movement of the
peppermill remote control [ 73], by cranking (Figure 4d),or by in-
sertingaphysicalkeytopoweradoorlock(seeFigure4c). Research
onsuchinteractionshavedemonstratedtheneedforengagingwith
functional demonstrators [ 43], but also a new aesthetic orientation
that rethinks energy in interaction, in which every bit of data or
processing power is valued. While posing new wicked problems
TEI ’25, March 04–07, 2025, Bordeaux / Talence, France Ylva Fernaeus
regarding labour and ergonomics, the experience of manually pow-
ering a computer system is not necessarily negative, but appears to
potentially provide a fulfilling sense of empowerment [52].
Aconclusionhereisthateco-designforthecontextofinteractive
systems needs to consider electronic components and not least
aspects related to energy. With this follows questions of what
aspects of an interactive setting that needs to be e.g. connected to
the internet, include robotic movement, bright light or play audio,
or whether less spectacular solutions may be found more efficient,
and thus, more attractive.
3.3 Recycling
The third strategy for sustainable design concerns the development
of products so that they, and their components, can be more easily
recycled, e.g. by making it possible to disassemble and exchange
parts. Is it possible to construct a smartphone to last a lifetime? Is
it realistic to trust the online services upon which it depends, or
even the human practices they aim at supporting, to last forever?
If not, the physical as well as interactive components will need to
be carefully designed with that insight in mind. While this was for
longacompletelyneglectedaspectofhigh-techproductdesign,this
strategy is undertaken from the physical side by a growing number
of manufacturers, most notably Fairphone, as well as by companies
that thrive on the repair, upgrading, refurbishing and reselling used
devices. This also resonates with the ever-growing stream of re-
search that focuses on care, repair and craft, as a counter-reaction
to the innovation-frenzy that previously dominated the interaction
designdiscourse. ExamplesincludeMandelandJu’smaterialre-use
of hoverboards in what they call ‘Garbatrage’ design [ 44], but we
see this more broadly also in the rise of for instance communal
makerspacesandinternationalrepairdays. Otherexamplesinclude
articulations of wabi-sabi as a design philosophy within HCI [ 69],
and a conceptual refocus in interaction design that emphasise elec-
tronic media as materially- and socially grounded. The extensive
explorations of hybrid crafting, using electronics in combination
with traditional studio crafts, play along the same design interests
of material maintenance and re-use.
Important to mention here is the role of digital media for repair-
oriented design, and the strong interplay between material crafts
and online tutorials, inspirational videos, and examples shared on
social media. Note for instance the youtuber sharing his experi-
ence of making a Switch game controller out of wood (see Figure
4e), or the amount of Etsy accounts offering custom made organic
looking skins for game controllers, in which synthetic versions
of natural materials are valued for their visual aesthetics. While
such skins might appear as mere surface level ‘greenwashing’, the
possibility to replace a worn surface level material when it gets
worn out, instead of replacing the entire gadget, and that we see
craftspeople specialising in providing such services, fundamentally
reflects a culture in which repairing holds value, allowing for e.g.
refurbishing and second hand use of electronic devices [75].
This points to an alternative take on production, assuming a
crafting-oriented culture, in which users enthusiastically seem to
engage in assembling products at home (as in the Green hide away
chair above) and turn online to find out how to repair their broken
gadgets. In such a culture, products may be explicitly designed tobe recycled, resold, and repaired, rather than merely to satisfy a
commercially driven desire for the new and shiny.
3.4 Expand the product’s life span
As Verbeek and Kockelkoren [ 49] discussed already in the late
nineties, fully functioning artefacts get thrown away because of a
cultural obsession with the new, but also because many modern
devices are designed so that they cannot be kept working. While
their own design concept addressed this challenge through a rather
romanticspeculation,theyalsohighlightedhowworkingtoexpand
a product’s life span is a problem of culture, which may be hard to
address through an individual design project alone. And still, this
very same design challenge remains to this day.
However, in a study of a 150 year old Jacquard loom still in
use [21] we could see this strategy at work. We could not claim
that this was purposefully pursued when the Jacquard loom was
originally designed, but, in line with the reasoning of Verbeek and
Kockelkoren, its design reflected a cultural climate quite different
from ours, and from which current design practices can learn. The
loom was entirely made from relatively fragile materials (wood,
cardboard and string), that could be easily repaired or replaced. It
could be adjusted and modified to fit for changing needs. Most
importantly, it was used to produce something still considered
valuable – locally produced, high-quality silk textile. It should also
benotedthatwhilethatloomwasstillinuse,itdidsointhecontext
of a museum, and as such was presented as a rarity. Indeed, it is not
uncommon with well-kept examples of ceramics, metal works and
furniture,seeninlong-term,continued,everydayuse,andantiquity
fairs and vintage markets show that such items do have value. In
comparison, contemporary high-tech products are known for their
exceptionally short life spans.
We all experience full disk spaces, declining battery life, broken
screens, and malfunctioning hardware. Recognizing this is needed
toprepareforlastingdesign,especiallyiftheserelyontechnologies
in constant advancement. An insight from these works is that we
cannot assume that hardware platforms, electricity, storage, means
of connectivity or that established standards will remain. A well-
known strategy for addressing unknown and changing use settings
is to design for improvements and adaptations, recognizing that
systems must be prepared for continued care.
Importantly, the solution does not seem to come in the form of
rocket science type of materials, but rather from down-to-earth
common sense use practices of how to care for everyday things. As
explained by Lucy Suchman [ 65], a bridge is only as stable as the
practices that uphold it, depending as much on social organizing
as on material construction. It is in a similar sense we may read
activities like Kombucha making as a relevant material practice
within the TEI discourse [ 8]. Similarly, high-tech products are only
as stable as ‘we’ as a culture are willing to invest in their continu-
ous use, in which it is more practical, economical, and simple, to
upgrade and repair than to replace. In this culture, it is no surprise
that a design firm such as The Mossiah [ 79], who designs e.g. moss-
covered loudspeakers, also give courses on how to make them, and
implicit to this is also teaching how to care for and to repair them.
Through a similar concept as the hideaway chair which is a de-
signed object that can be made but not bought, we also see similar
Turning Back to Planet Earth: Defining the Aestheticsof a NewSustainable High-Tech TEI ’25, March04–07, 2025, Bordeaux/ Talence,France
projects presented at TEI that reject not only the status of manufac-
turing but also decenters the concept of electronic technology, e.g.
Oneday Shoes [ 45]. This points to an aesthetic orientation of the
post-industrial ideals, that engages with consumer-oriented design
outside of conventional notions of industrial production.
4 Discussion
Bringing design work ‘down to earth’ could be seen as being about
pragmatism, to ground design work on real world practice and
material circumstance, about taking design visions down to a level
of realism and feasibility. But more fundamentally, or philosophi-
cally perhaps, it is also about material entanglements in the world,
within the biosphere, and with the living. This thereby brings our
perspectives down – all the way – to Earth, beyond immediate
contexts of use. Here three main features of this new design direc-
tion will be discussed: pragmatism and material frugality, biophilic
entanglements, and open, shifting and life-centred values when it
comes to aesthetic expressions.
4.1 Pragmatism and Material Frugality
The first theme points to a pragmatic approach that takes design
visionstoalevelofrealismandfeasibility, recognizingtheintercon-
nectedness of human-made designs within the real problems faced
in this world. To address these issues, a historical perspective was
adoptedtoanalysecontemporarytechnology,inanattempttoreach
abetterunderstandingofbothcurrentandemergingdesignvisions.
While more speculative approaches may highlight similar design
values, a stronger case can be made from studying existing designs,
and to learn from examples that were once considered promising
butthatfailedtodeliverinthewild. TheexamplefromtheMinority
Report for instance, belonged a family of ‘cave-interfaces’ in which
a person would stand alone in a windowless room to manipulate
on-screen information, which – once the technology became com-
mercially available – ultimately didn’t play out as an attractive or
desired work situation in real life.
The selection of examples of ‘down-to-earth’ designs in Figure
4 share a simplistic essence of very rudimentary character, far
fromthewow-factorexpressedbytheblinkinglightsandspaceship
aestheticsthatwehavebecomesoaccustomedtointhefieldof‘high
tech’. Asunsexyand‘uncool’astheseexamplesmayseem,theystill
appear inherently attractive, in the same sense as Cross [ 13] stated
that‘a designer does not use a process that he finds unsympathetic to
his own attitudes, or that generates a product which he dislikes’ [p.
7]. The fact that contemporary designers, and design researchers,
appear to likemaking such low-key, simple, caring and biologically
oriented designs is thus an important signal for us to attend to.
Design explorations at TEI has sometimes presented an ideal
of moving away from computer screens, aiming for an entirely
tactile and physical mode of being with technology. As highlighted
above,weshouldalsoacknowledgethatmediacontentispartofthe
contemporary blended world, and that media content is speaking,
if not about or with the voice of, at least to an audience of live
biological beings. The perceived problem of bridging the physical
and online spaces is very different now compared to when the
field of TEI was originally formed, with new physical interactions
not necessarily requiring the design of new physical things. Whatis experienced in everyday life is an intense blending of screen-
based media along with physical activities, in which new physical
interactions do not necessarily require new gadgets. Instead new
meaningful engagement can occur through existing technologies,
forinstanceaniPadappusedtolearnhowtoplayonarealphysical
piano by attending to audio signals and through its screen guiding
a learner where and how to place their fingers. This shows physical
interactions with and around technology without the default being
the making of new physical electronic gadgets. This highlights the
role for designers to stay attentive to what makes sense to people
and to the environment, and that low-cost, simple designs, often
appear more attractive than a more wasteful take on novelty within
interactive technology.
Thisthemeaddressesthepressingenvironmental, economic, and
political challenges faced by contemporary design practices, partic-
ularly concerning electronic waste, but also reduction of unneces-
sary computational power. The evolving aesthetic directions raise
important questions about sustainability and responsible design
practices. By focusing on everyday challenges and the implications
of design decisions, this approach seeks to foster innovation that is
mindful of its environmental impact.
4.2 Biophilic Entanglements
Understanding computer systems as integrated within the bio-
sphere, rather than isolated in a digital void, appears central to
the current aesthetic directions discussed in this text. Such design
efforts critique the conventional aesthetics of high-tech designs,
favoring examples that highlight the complexities of social and ma-
terial ecosystems. This perspective shifts interaction design from
a simplistic one-to-one user-system model to a more nuanced un-
derstanding of ‘fluid assemblages’ that involve multiple contexts,
systems, artefacts, and living entities. This reality of contemporary
high-tech designs means that any design challenge will always
involve considerations of several systems, several people, multiple
contexts, and a world in constant change. Importantly, this mesh
also includes the ‘low-tech’, the materialities outside of computers,
and nature itself.
Theshiftfrommedia-technologicalgadgets,withaprimaryfocus
on representing data in new forms, to designs that also engage with
the material environment reflects a philosophical understanding
but also a desire for the living, as living biological beings. Projects
that incorporate biomaterials or hybrid crafting practices may in
this sense be appreciated not merely for their novelty but for their
aesthetic appreciation of earthly grounding and their systemic im-
plications. While the early TEI exemplars focused on the ambitions
to support the connection of sensing human bodies to various in-
teractive technologies, this new stream of works is furthering the
ambitions to connect our designs also to the material biosphere
we are all depending on. Importantly, these complexities not only
concern computational aspects, but also the social and material
(eco)systems they affect, and where complexity is not to be seen
as a hurdle to overcome or to ‘design away’, but as an evocative
feature of reality to be embraced by designers and researchers alike
(see e.g. Figure 4f). This theme is embraced also in popular fiction,
such as in the contemporary animated film The Wild Robot [ 12], in
which a case is made of a humanoid machine adapting to wildlife
TEI ’25, March 04–07, 2025, Bordeaux / Talence, France Ylva Fernaeus
on a remote island, and towards the end of the film being broken,
repaired and covered in rust and moss (see Figure 4h).
Here we should point out that simply including biomaterials
or other species (e.g. hooking up a live plant to an electronic
system) or an elaborate hybrid crafting practice, can never count
as sustainable as such. Neither can we assume such experiments
to take on a more systemic perspective on interaction than say,
an engineering effort aiming to reduce data traffic to minimize
electrical consumption. Yet, we can see that these projects are
following an aesthetic appreciation towards the earthy biology we
are all part of, and this is noteworthy. In that case, also biomimicry,
or the inclusion of greenery depicted in direct surroundings of
technology (see the iLoq in Figure 4c), becomes central to the world
aimed for in the design work.
This direction is an attempt to articulate the aesthetics of blend-
ing the artificial with the living, in what we read as careful, criti-
cal, and circular design practices. Importantly these explorations
intersect various fields, including engineering, artistic practice,
contemporary philosophy, and science, investigating mechanisms
that extend beyond the conventional concerns of state-of-the-art
industrial design. Here, the interrogation of design mechanisms
transcends traditional industrial practices, encouraging a more
nuanced understanding of the interplay between technology and
human experience.
4.3 Design Values as Culturally Negotiated
As mentioned above, the historical perspective taken in this essay,
in a sense reality-checking design visions from the past, could po-
tentially inform current and future design visions. Importantly, as
culture and technical circumstances evolve, so do the practicality of
specific design visions and concepts. As commonly noted, Durrel
Bishop’s iconic marble answering machine of the 1990’s [see e.g.
31], was fundamentally tied to a context of using wired telephones
and voice-operated answering machines, which from a perspec-
tive of today’s technological landscape appears rather farfetched
however simplistic and practice-grounded it appeared at its time.
This also highlights how design visions should be understood to
speak more about its current societal concerns, and thereby more
than anything working as historical artefacts [ 1]. Such backwards-
looking perspective may help to highlight how design values shift
over time, and that tastes, styles and aesthetic norms are matters
set in constant cultural negotiation and for which there will al-
ways be openings for disagreement. Rather than a monoculture
allowingonly one visual style or identity, the post-industrial design
vision points to a multitude of locally grounded, craft based, and
contextually driven practices. Within this plurality, there should
be openings for an endless variety of sustainable high-tech designs
to come.
Withinthiscontext,wecouldseehowHuman-ComputerInterac-
tion (HCI) is increasingly aligning with the ideals of post-industrial
design, perhaps especially within the field of Tangible and Embed-
ded Interaction (TEI). Engagements by media artists and crafts com-
munities have demonstrated how regional crafts and subcultures
can inform and enrich product design, allowing for the creation
of objects that resonate with diverse aesthetic sensibilities. This,
together with recent hype of ‘post-digital’ manual crafts, highlightsthefeltexperienceofbeingactivelyengaged,ofdevelopingskills,of
not just passively receiving the ready-made. Instead of the friction-
free vision of ubiquitous computing, or body-less intelligence, the
post-industrial vision appears to embrace the experience of manual
work, as craftspeople but also as users.
It seems that recent economic, political, and environmental
challenges, coupled with a renewed interest in material practices,
thereby prompted the emergence of alternative design values. This
evolving aesthetic direction influences interactive systems and ex-
periences, with a particularly pressing concern within our field
being the negative environmental impact associated with high-tech
products, especially regarding electronic waste. Everyday chal-
lenges associated with this theme includes ensuring that service
upgrades and new product versions do not exacerbate existing en-
vironmental problems associated with the design, use, and waste
of technology. Through this lens, we can better navigate the com-
plexities of design, fostering practices that are not only innovative
but also environmentally responsible, and from which perspective
the once ‘cool’ might now rather be dispelled as ‘cold’. In this pa-
per we have combined insights from various historical movements
and contemporary design trends (e.g., Solarpunk), to comment on
the broader design field, within which TEI is only one small part,
but with its focus on the research front of high-tech interactive
systems holding the inherent potential to generate constructive
impacts and drive significant, long-lasting change.
5 Conclusion
Wehaveherediscussedhowresearchteams,designstudents,artists,
makers, and activists, are gathering within the context of TEI to
continuously and playfully explore the aesthetic potential of repair,
upcycling, repurposing, as well as new technical solutions that
support more sustainable electronic products and services. By
such experimenting with material forms, technologies, styles, and
expressions,theTEIconference’sinterdisciplinarycontextprovides
a very fertile intellectual climate for debate, critique and reflection.
By revisiting notions of post-industrial design in the context of
established approaches for sustainable product design, we have
analysed how today’s design practices are materially linked to spe-
cific technological and societal trends. We discussed this through
three interpretations of how a sustainable TEI moves away from a
‘spaceshipaesthetics’ , through pragmatism and material frugality,
systemic and biophilic design, and through diverse, shifting and
plural takes on aesthetic ideals. These three themes collectively
highlighttheneedforanapproachtodesignthatprioritizessustain-
able design as a culturally grounded engagement with the material
world.
To sum up, a large number of projects are currently using mate-
rial craftsmanship to engage with hopeful visions of a sustainable
future, drawing on strong themes in contemporary culture, expos-
ing some of the aesthetic qualities that appear to characterize the
experience of sustainably designed products. Importantly, this goes
beyond surface materials to focus also on interactive functionality,
with a tendency to value a felt experience of rich textures, warmth,
brightness, earthy materials and flourishing live plants. To sum this
up, it seems this spaceship is turning back to planet Earth.
